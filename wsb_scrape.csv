17,SHORT COVERING 3/17 - $GME $AMC $RKT $BB $NOK,bosshax,"**Short Interest report from S3 Partners update for March 17th**   Brokers feed data into S3 so that they can figure out what borrow rate to charge for lending shares out. This helps 'validate' that the 'ability to borrow' is related to the 'borrow fee'. We can use this information as a barometer to guess/indicate how many shorts are covering as a net position AND we can see the affect on price.   &amp;#x200B;      **$AMC has significant short covering! More to come!**  We see this starting as of March 10th and this drove up demand volumes on price. Remember the price only goes up if there are more buyers than sellers. By keeping an eye on short covering you can, to some extent, predict how much intrinsic buying demand there is in a stock. There are many unknowns however including how many other sellers may be taking profits, closing positions OR new buyers entering.     [$AMC](   **$GME not THAT much short covering! A lot more potential here!**   You can quickly compare AMC to GME and see that shorts are not covering in the same way and in the last couple days the price has actually been falling. What this tells me is other holders are simply selling, maybe people are worried, but the shorts are not driving up the price.... yet! This bodes well for HODL!  [$GME](   &amp;#x200B;  **$RKT covering only started TODAY!**  RKT has been trading sideways and consolidating. I've covered this stock in some other DD and it looks ready to go up. There are still some paper-hands that are selling but as of today we're seeing the shorts panic with the latest optimistic housing data. They realize this isn't going lower and want to get out NOW before they get crushed....

Looks good.**   **$GME: Only a little bit of covering, relatively, so there are a lot of shorts that are not covering and likely do not feel like they need to yet! HODL**   **$RKT: Short covering started only today! Prepare for takeoff!**   **$BB: It's a battle right now and unclear who is winning just yet!**    **$NOK: Absolutely NOTHING happening**     We can use short covering to make informed expectations about future price movements!",wallstreetbets,1,1615999599,m74p9p

It helps connects buyers and sellers of vacation assets.  Its at ATH. about 43% higher than the pre March market dump. Not going to get into the fundamentals as to why its so much higher because it doesnt fucking matter. This hoe needs to see a reversion to the mean. Just look at the daily/weekly/monthly chart. Take a peak at the RSI (9 day or 20 day). Sprinkle in a look at some bollinger bands. You will see how stupidly overextended this stock is. Lastly, just understand the industry its in. the travel industry.   WHY THE FUCK would expedia be at all time highs right now? Ya, sure, vaccines are rolling out and its all looking nice moving forward. But this hoe has seen one of, if not the worst, yearly performance on record.  Anyways. Its PUT time. Price Target is $150 within a month. Im looking for an entry point on 160 puts with a 4/16 expiry. You can go out longer if you want to dish out the additional capital. Im more than willing to roll my 4/16 puts if we dont see the drop that im expecting by that time.  &amp;#x200B;  TL:DR: EXPE over extended AF. Needs to have a reversion to the mean. Its ATH after having a shit year in the travel industry. 160 P 4/16 EXP. Can go out longer if you want to pay a higher upfront cost.

RTXz 401ks (which handles investing several billion $$$) announced that they will be removing Carrier (CARR) and OTISz stocks from their 401k plans during the 1st two weeks of April. RTXz asked employees to manually move any holdings out of OTISz/CARRz investments in their 401k to any of the other ETF/funds offered by the company's 401k plan before April. Otherwise RTXz will transfer those funds from OTIS/CARR investments to other funds in the 401k automatically.  &amp;#x200B;  Why OTISz instead of CARRz? Carrier was relatively low at the time while OTISz is currently at its all time high.

41,YOLO - A significantly undervalued TopGolf ($ELY) competitor reopening play with massive upside potential,GoodVibesWow,"Edit: Mods - automod doesn't like me. Trying again. This is my own personal YOLO over the next several months.  TLDR; Drive Shack is an undervalued reopening play that is likely to triple in the next 6 months. Ape buy stock and ape get more banana. This is a stock trading under 5 that doesn't deserve to be.   # The Bull Case  What is Drive Shack? A stock under $4 that could easily triple in the next 6 months. Read on my fellow YOLOers. Drive Shack owns and operates multiple golf-related leisure and entertainment venues. It‚Äôs a boozy golf concept ‚Äì think Topgolf ($ELY). Shares in Drive Shack have rallied by over 115% in the last year, with increasing volume over the last several months and significantly more Institutional ownership being added even as you read this.  **Market Cap**: 286.4M  **Share Float**: 59.97M  **% Held by Institutions**: 35.69%  **% Held by Insiders**: 13.16%  **Short % of Float**: 1.3%  Quarterly supplement report [here](   Drive Shack owns and/or operates 60 traditional golf courses and is the parent company of American Golf (AGC). They operate 6 Top Golf Style venues in Orlando, Florida; Raleigh, North Carolina; Richmond, Virginia; West Palm Beach, Florida; Manhattan, New York and a New Orleans, LA venue on hold.  &amp;#x200B;     Here is where things get interesting. Drive Shack intends to open a number of new ‚ÄúPuttery‚Äù venues. What is Puttery? Think High Tech Miniature golf for adults + cocktails + premium food. They have recently announced a strategic partnership with Rory McIlroy for collaboration with the Puttery concept.  &amp;#x200B;     Their goal is to build 17 Puttery venues and complete the Drive Shack Manhattan by the end of 2022. Target Puttery venue EBITDA is $2 to $3 million and Drive Shack venue EBITDA is $4 to $6 million.  # Why does this matter?  As we can see, the cost to develop a Puttery is significantly lower than the capital required to build and operate a Topgolf style Drive Shack location. ROI is also significantly higher with the Puttery concept. By 2024 they are targeting over 50+ Puttery venues.  &amp;#x200B;     Their next biggest competitor is of course Topgolf. Top Golf was recently acquired by Callaway Golf Company ($ELY). Topgolf currently has 28 open locations in the United States, with another dozen opening soon all over the place. Topgolf is continuing on its expansion plans in major American cities, as well expanding into Australia, Mexico and Canada through licensing deals. ELY details below:  **Market Cap**: 5.7B  **Share Float**: 93.1M  **% Held by Institutions: 105.76%**  **Short % of Float**: 16.77%  What did Top Golf recently announce they will be investing significantly in? [High Tech Miniature Golf For Adults](  of course. They are doing precisely what Drive Shack is doing, because the Puttery style concept is more lucrative and costs significantly less to develop. Pay particular attention to the % held by institutions. The real money often comes from institutional investors. Professional money managers are always looking to outperform the benchmark. In the exhibit below, we can clearly see the accelerated interest from institutional and professional money managers, with money increasingly flowing into Drive Shack. This is because professional money managers **want and need to** outperform the S&amp;P to keep their clients happy. They will continue to scoop up Drive Shack in the coming months which will put considerable upward pressure on the stock price.  # How High Can She Go?  Real high mother fucker. Let‚Äôs have a look at the institutional ownership. Where the ‚Äúsmart money‚Äù is allocated currently.  &amp;#x200B;     As we can see, over 36% **OF ALL** 13f filings own Drive Shack ‚Äì up from 33% previously. What is our PUT/CALL ratio among 13/f filers? 9.32. That‚Äôs right ape. 9-to-1 are shorting. Buy why? How many total Calls do we have? A mere 208 thousand. Why? Likely these short positions among 13f filers are simply there to protect themselves on the downside. Why so few Calls being sold? Would you sell covered Calls on an asset that you know is going to moon? No you wouldn‚Äôt dummy. But you would protect yourself on the downside ‚Äì which is precisely what the smart money is doing. They are grabbing this stock hand over fist and this trend will only accelerate.  Realistically the market cap for Drive Shack could end up between $1-2B in the next 18 months, perhaps higher. This is simply based on the number of Puttery‚Äôs and Drive Shack venues they intend to open and the accelerating trend of people getting back out into the world in the wake of the Rona. **This could also be an M&amp;A target as the market cap grows.** The market is forward looking and it will begin to price in this expansion quickly as the economy reopens.  **A market cap of $2B implies a Drive Shack share price of $12-18 dollars.**  # The Rona Factor  New COVID infection numbers are declining in the US. New treatments and therapeutics are coming out every day. In the US, it looks like this summer may get close to resembling something that we remember as ‚Äúnormal‚Äù. In short, there is massive pent up demand for this kind of shit. Have you ever driven by a Topgolf? Those fuckers are always packed. I‚Äôve been myself several times and while it‚Äôs not exactly my thing, people throw money at it like your mom at the club. People are tired of being on lock down. The next 6-18 months in the US are going to see an explosion of interest in these kinds of leisure related activities as the virus fades into a distant memory, like your shit stains do after several washes.  # Latest Earnings  [Drive Shack Jumps 18% As 4Q Earnings Exceed Estimates | Nasdaq](   The stock has been on fire as of late. Why? Drive Shack's earnings announced on 3/12/2021 of $0.13 per share compared favorably with the year-ago period's loss of $0.25 per share. **Analysts were expecting a loss of $0.19 per share.**  Revenues of $60.3 million topped the Street‚Äôs estimates of $55.7 million but declined 16% year-on-year, mainly due to lower revenues from the company‚Äôs four entertainment Drive Shack golf venues amid COVID-19 restrictions which led to lower event revenue. Nevertheless, the company said, ‚ÄúThe strong momentum and demand for traditional golf continued for American Golf throughout the fourth quarter of 2020.‚Äù  From the CEO on the last earnings call, ‚ÄúAs we look ahead into 2021, our focus remains on strategic priorities to drive growth and profitability, including the launch and expansion of Puttery, capturing market share using data and analytics, growing brand awareness and advancing technology and innovation to remain at the forefront in our space. With our currently liquidity position and relatively unlevered balance sheet, we can maintain flexibility and optimize our capital stricture to be better positioned to react to future business needs. We believe 2021 will be a momentous year for us that is carried by a team that sets us apart and will drive us forward.‚Äù  Key takeaway: **2021 will be a ‚Äúmomentous‚Äù year.**  # Upcoming earnings  The next scheduled earnings date is 5/5/2021 to 5/10/2021. Most of their locations have had to deal with capacity limitations and other Rona related shutdowns. Revenue and earnings numbers will likely be impressive when they next report earnings. All of their locations will be at or near full reopening‚Äôs as COVID shutdowns begin to wind down. They will also likely make announcements regarding the upcoming Puttery rollouts. **This will put further upward pressure on the stock price.**  # New Analyst Coverage  The number of analyst and boutiques that track a stock can have a significant impact on price direction. Let‚Äôs have a look at the number of analysts currently covering Drive Shack:  &amp;#x200B;     Now let‚Äôs compare that to $ELY (Topgolf):  &amp;#x200B;     As we can see, the analyst coverage for $ELY is significantly higher than Drive Shack. Overtime, the increased analyst coverage has pushed $ELY much higher. As new analysts begin to initiate coverage on Drive Shack and add their price targets, it will put further upward pressure on the stock price. **The current price target for Drive Shack is $5**. Institutional investors will therefore become more interested and the market cap will continue to grow. When a respected analyst simply initiates coverage on a stock it can often itself serve as a catalyst to push a stock price ever higher. I believe the coverage on Drive Shack will increase significantly in the coming months.  [Drive Shack Jumps 18% As 4Q Earnings Exceed Estimates](   Of particular note, ‚ÄúBTIG analyst Peter Saleh maintained a Buy rating and a price target of $5 (59.2% upside potential) on the stock. In a note to investors, the analyst said that despite soft sales, the company recorded ‚Äúmaterially better than expected‚Äù earnings in 4Q. Looking ahead, Saleh expects cost-savings measures to continue to drive EBITDA growth as COVID-19 restrictions ease.‚Äù  In Conclusion  Drive Shack is a stock that has primarily traded well above $4 since 2013. The Rona has significantly depressed the price of this asset. Institutional money has been flowing rapidly into this company. The smart money already knows where the price is headed. As lockdowns begin to lift and COVID infections/death rates plummet in the US, people will be desperate for leisure activities within the US. Boozy golf is the medicine everyone needs. This trend in behavior will likely push the stock price well above $7 in the next 6-9 months. If the Puttery concept proves successful, this stock will be trading above $10 quickly.

66,"Do we have ANY info, or is there ANY outcome, that is not favorable for us? [GME]",Max326,"Hello there, fellow apes.  I'm here to ask a question that has been with me for quite a long time. The deeper we are with buying and HODLing $GME, the less I'm seeing reasonable bearish posts or comments about that stock (to be exact, I'm seeing none). I'm really trying my best to find any negative analysis on our fucking moon-rocket on WSB and other $GME-related subreddits and I'm not really finding shit.   I've been reading many DDs, Technical Analyses, Discussions, you name it.  For example, this seems solid and explains much about short selling and why they shorted Geee Emm Eeeee in the first place:  [   What bothers me is this: Is this possible by mods deleting all the bearish stuff about $GME, or is it really that good? I mean ALL (99%) of bearish stuff can be found on CNBC, Jim Cramer's babbling and others, but here? NONE of that gets any recognition. All I saw here on WSB, was a post saying that we should keep putting pressure on them by buying options with a strike price closer to the current price, and just putting all we can afford in shares.  Is it really a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity, and not pouring our whole savings in it is plain stupid? I'm a college freshman and I poured everything I can in it (that I can afford to lose), but is it worth just fucking pouring in EVERYTHING? If there's no bad outcome, except a fucking miraculous save by the government, or some DFV's evil clone appearing on the other side out of thin air, why is it not on the moon yet? Is it that people don't understand the stuff going on with GameStonk and that's the reason behind not going in? I'm seriously running out of ideas what could go wrong with that.   As far as I understand, the HFs are just kicking the can down the road in hopes for the company falling. They just keep shorting the company, bleeding money on paying premiums to their brokerages. Correct me if I'm wrong, but to me, that's like postponing the inevitable death! They're making it a fucking nightmare for who'll have to cover the shorts for them when they inevitably run out of money and the squeeze finally hits.  I mean, what the fuck? It's that I'm not understanding something, or they are more retarded than the whole WallStreetBets community combined.  And no, I'm not complaining about being a millionaire if it hits 100k, I'm here with my 6 shares and holding. (where I live a US dollar is 3.87 in our currency rn)  TL;DR why can't I find any bearish posts on GME ANYWHERE besides the news? And we know that news are connected directly to HFs, so that's just bullshit and won't make any sense.

97,PLTR DD - How Apollo will let Palantir take over SaaS in the age of a fractured internet,midnightshitposts,"Strap in ~~retards~~ apes, this might be a heftier read than what you crayon-gobbling lot typically do on a regular basis.   Go to about the 7 minute mark in [this interview of Alex Karp ](  where he mentions Apollo:  &gt; We built this product which has gotten very little attention called Apollo. Apollo allows us to maintain and deliver software to any number of clients without essentially growing our Palantir force at all. So we're planning--now that we have Apollo--to grow the number of super cool customers all over the world, and we can do it all without raising headcount.  As he explains it, Apollo allows Palantir to:  &gt; deliver the whole stack in 6 hour [...] We can do this with a small number of people, sitting in our one office that we have, maintaining, updating, and providing them with the product that we build. So they don't have the Frankenstein's monster that takes 2 years to build, and has to be maintained with either human hours--like in gov contract case--or by purchasing new product, or compensating sales people or hiring new IT people that you don't even like talking to. You can actually buy one stack.   And the last thing he mentions in the interview is a question regarding what happens if the world's internet splits apart into separate jurisdictions due to de-globalization:   &gt; The architecture we built - both for PG and Foundry - will allow a superset to work with a subset. Which means if the world splinters and every country has its jurisdictions, it's gonna be very hard for normal software companies because they're not built to do that. But it's going to be very good for Palantir.   ------  #Apollo  So just what *is* Apollo? For one - [Apollo: Explained](  The concept is actually pretty simple - here's the dumbed down version:  Most enterprise SaaS companies run on the public cloud and use a single cloud provider.   Palantir software must run on a multitude of different clouds, including purpose-built government or classified clouds separate from standard public cloud, due to the need of their contracts.   Apollo allows Palantir to deploy Foundry seamlessly regardless of the type of cloud the end user's data operates on. In other words, Apollo allows Palantir to deploy Foundry onto AWS, Azure, Google, or more unique clouds like CIA Cloud without needing to write individualized code for those deployments.   Coupled with Palantir's familiarity with working on different unique end-user environments (which they had to do for the army with Gotham), they are essentially running a multi-cloud SaaS instead of a single-cloud SaaS.  As different countries start passing their own regulations on the internet--privacy, data sharing, etc., this will force SaaS companies serving different customers to adapt.   Meanwhile, Palantir has already prepared for this inevitable outcome by developing Apollo: the continuous delivery system that enables multi-cloud SaaS on whatever cloud infrastructure available to them--public or private.   **Remember:** Palantir's entire service is helping customers pull their data quickly and effortlessly.   Boomer companies that acquired hot startups and need to integrate that data will most likely be operating on a multi-cloud environment. Same is true for a US-based internet company operating across the world where privacy and data collection laws may be more stringent.     ----  #Implications  In the Apollo article, it ends with:  &gt;  We run our software in a homogenous way across heterogeneous environments, powered by Apollo. Apollo is the platform that makes it possible to bring a unified SaaS to our entire customer base.  Now pair that up with what Karp said at the end of his interview:  &gt; The architecture we built - both for PG and Foundry - will allow a superset to work with a subset. Which means if the world splinters and every country has its jurisdictions, it's gonna be very hard for normal software companies because they're not built to do that. But it's going to be very good for Palantir.   The world is slowly but surely headed towards different internet blocs, with the EU enacting more stringent data protection laws, China with its Great Firewall, India using the power of periodic internet shutdowns and the push to develop more indigenous software talent, and Russia periodically talking about shutting itself off from the rest of the internet.   This means multinational firms will eventually be forced to separate out their data in Europe, Japan, and the US. For companies that have already transitioned to the cloud, critical code could be held in entirely different countries and subjected to entirely different sharing laws.   Palantir's software allows a viewer to *look* at only the pertinent part of the code through Foundry's prioritization of intent as part of its privacy features. But more importantly, Palantir can continue to deliver Foundry even as the laws continuously change and get refined.   Furthermore, Apollo is also going to drastically cut back on the number of people that Palantir will need to hire to maintain their code. This further cuts down on the biggest cost - employee stock compensation - and allows Palantir to really start growing its profit margins even further on super sticky clients who continues coming back for more.   **tl;dr**: PLTR 150 12/31/22",wallstreetbets,1,1615995246,m732kt

39,"Request for a SIMPLE explanation of how options work, and how they impact price and volume.",M3T4LM0NG0,"!!! This thread is for informational purposes only and does not provide financial advise. !!!  \--------  First off, hello and kudos for doing what you do. I'm observing Reddit, specifically WSB, for quite some time now. Followed the $GME saga with big interest, and vouching for you since end of February when I caught the actual story behind it. It's absolutely refreshing, and I hope the movie will catch it all.  I did invest a big load into $GME, but got ass-kicked with the recent free fall and lost my earnings from a whole month. Not something to worry about, because I never invest more than I can afford to lose. Still annoying to lose money, especially to hedgies and other people who play unfair.  I'd really like to throw another, actually much bigger load on $GME. Not essentially to make quick gains (for sure this is a factor), but I'm intending to keep at least half of the shares, because I like gaming.  However, I never do the same mistake in life twice. So, before I do it - which I really, REALLY would like to do - I need to understand options, how they work, weather and how they impact price and volume.  I've read a bunch of articles about it, and while Investopedia is a great source and generally provides the best informations, I'm still unable to catch the whole thing. There's always a lot of Jibbering, FOMO and FUD in it. I get that options are complicated and risky, and even professionals have their issues understanding them.  I'm not interested in things like risk factors and ""tips for my well-being"". I'm ONLY interested in the rules, the rest is upon me. I like numbers and facts, and I like when they're covered by good sources.  Please, my little ape friends, give me a good reason to be stupid again on $GME.

6,Is it possible that the hedge funds have now secured themselves a net long position?,Antifogmatic_Head,"This wouldn't affect or prevent the short squeeze from happening, as they still need to exit their short positions, but I think it's theoretically possible they might actually have put so many long call options and purchased a few million shares in the last 6 weeks since they crashed the price on January 28th, that the hedge funds now have a neutral or only a minimally negative impact from the short squeeze occurring, isn't it?  Similar to what Goldman Sachs did to Michael Burry in reality (and played by Christian Bale / Batman in the movie The Big Short), when the hedge funds endlessly delayed his payout of Michael Burry's short position on their mortgage-backed securities (MBS). When Goldman Sachs finally called him and said they can make good on the payment, Michael Burry calls them out, saying (paraphrasing), ""I think what you mean to say is you now have sold enough of your trash mortgage-backed securities and now have a net short position."" (Which would benefit them in that circumstance since the housing mortgage market was about to collapse).  I think it may be possible that the hedge funds have been attempting to do the same so they can survive the nuclear fallout of the short squeeze. The nuke is still going to drop, and their house will still be destroyed by the squeeze, but they fought back the invading army of apes long enough that they have built themselves a fallout shelter below the barn.  *By the way, it is a fact that no one's ever seen Christian Bale and Batman in the same room, so while this post isn't investment advice, this fact \*is\* highly sus.*",wallstreetbets,1,1615993618,m72gsb

68,GeM E Saga Act 2: American Rescue Plan Enters Stage Left,jforest1,"Imagine being a Hedgehog and staring this in the face:     Aside from the obvious $424 BILLION dollars in stimmies (hitting today for a lot of people and transferred into brokerage accounts beginning between now and Monday/Tuesday of next week), consider there are other parts that will go into the pockets of the poors as well over the next year:  * Unemployment insurance extensions: $246B * Tax credits, aid, and child care for families: $219B * Renters and homeowners: $40B  I'm going to do some tablecloth math here so bull with me. Let's assume the stimmies may trickle into the markets at a higher rate than the secondary categories of benefits. I'm going to give the stimmies a ""penetration rate"" of 4%. That is, 4% of that money will make its way into the stock market. *Of that* 4%, let's say 1% goes towards GeM E. This is a grand total **1/2500** or **0.04%**. In other words, **1/25th** of one percent.  Secondly, for the secondary funds, I'll assume a penetration rate of **1%**. *Of that*, let's say again that **1%** goes towards GeM E. That comes to **1/10000** or **0.01%**. In other words, **1/100th** of one percent.  I think these numbers are reasonable, based on my gut. That's it. Adjust upwards or downwards based on your gut, actual numbers of retail moving into the market after the first two stimmy checks, or whatever actual evidence-based you like.  Another big factor which may affect the penetration rate is UNCERTAINTY, which is created among other things by price movement in GeM E and negative media sentiment. Of course GeM E veterans know the crux is about owning the float, but normies and newbies look at volatility as a reason to be scared and maybe not throw some extra play money into GeM E for ""the hell of it.""  So let's do the math:  $424B \* 0.0004 = $169,600,000  ($246B + $219B + $40B) \* 0.0001 = $50,500,000  $169,600,000 + $50,500,000 = $220,100,000 of new money into GeM E  This is one of many reasons why the Hedgehogs are doing their best to keep the momentum that was building into last week at bay. Here are how many GeM E shares $220,100,000 will buy at different stonk price points:  * $300: 733,666 stonks * $250: 880,400 stonks * $200 (roughly current price): 1,100,500 stonks * $150: 1,467,333 stonks * $100: 2,201,000 stonks * $50: 4,402,000 stonks  I feel like at a lower price there will have been some downward momentum that may scare away purchasing to some degree while MORE shares may be purchased due to lower price.  If price is moving up then there may be more momentum causing purchasing but with lower purchasing power.  Ultimately, my napkin math says there will be \~1M shares purchased from stimmies, and more over the course of a year from liberated finances from the secondary funds.  Obviously, that kind of upward pressure on a stock that has a published float of 54M shares (when you take diamond hander's shares out of the float, you are talking even less shares), that has the potential to seriously move the needle.  \----------------  **TL; DR: The American Rescue Plan will create significant upward pressure on GeM E. Probably more than most consider. I'm guestimating about 1M shares will be purchased, regardless of price point/momentum.**  \-----------------  *Obligatory Disclaimer: These are just spitball numbers, do your own math.

But I've been through a whole host of crazy market events:  * *Dotcom crash* * *9/11 crash* * *housing crash* * *COVID crash* * *and now, the Gamestop short squeeze*  Financially, I've made out well in every scenario for being a contrarian (financially disciplined and often betting on the long term upside during short term catastrophes). Here I am, again taking a positive position with contrarians. This time against the notion that Gamestop as a company is done. Against the notion that it should be shorted into oblivion by the Hedgehogs. Against the notion that ""smart money"", that those with immense financial resources, always win. Against the notion that the system is rigged against the retail investor, from the days E\*TRADE was airing ads of the retail investor throwing bricks through bulge bracket firms' windows (cannot find a link to this commercial) to the days that RobinHood made a similar marketing promise.  **What We're Up Against**  It's hard to imagine the scale of the money involved, so I'll give a hypothetical example. For a sense of scale, if I had 10 billion dollars on one side of a stock trade, and the slippery morals, I could put out $1,000,000 contracts to have FIVE THOUSAND GME apes assassinated, and still come out with $5B remaining. If you have doubt about short ladders, media manipulation, character assassination, brokerages restricting trades, or LITERALLY ANYTHING ELSE being possible, I hope my example illustrates what else is possible with that much money.  **Wisdom and Typical Behavior**  Having been through all of the above, I know that people in power do EVERYTHING they can do to maintain it, legal or no, ethically shady or no. And--to their advantage generally--the mob is like a flock of birds, each following the tail feathers of the one in front of it. Sometimes people in power harness this truth about groups of people, sometimes they attack it. We've seen a little of both in this situation. But what's unique here is that there are many birds in this flock that fly North in the springtime because they have a strong Reason to.  **Fundamentals of the Company vs Fundamentals of the Market**  I may not understand the intricacies of the market, I may not know all the factors that tie a share of a company to the fundamentals of the company. For the most part, I agree with Mark Cuban that they are these days much divorced.  But...I do know how supply and demand works: people who buy GME and hold own the supply, people who shorted the stock are saddled with their chosen demand. That's a fundamental of the market that was exposed by this movement, and its effect is undeniable.  **The Trade**  When I read about WSB buying GME and others because the meme was funny, the nostalgia was real, and the short squeeze was possible, it appealed to me. I took a 5% percentage of my portfolio and moved it into GME, AMC, and BB (in that order in percentage, and I've consolidated those positions into GME fully since in order to focus). I categorized the trade mentally as a ""do or die"", that is it either moons or flatlines (binary trade). Thus, at the onset my goal was set.  **This is the Way**  I had a gut check when GME went over $400, because like many others, it was a huge return. I also had one when the price sunk to $40. But I didn't sell out, because that wasn't my reason for the trade in the first place. In fact, I'm pretty proud to say that I bought on the trip down, increasing the amount of shares bought all the way down to low 50s. My position relative to my portfolio TRIPLED from 5% to 15%. As a do or die trade, I will hold it long after the memes stop coming, the nostalgia wanes, and hopes of a short squeeze fade...or until my patience allows me to watch it moon.  Why can I hold rather than ""cut my losses""? Because it was a binary trade from the get go. There was no loss limit. I'm financially disciplined and that's the decision I made at the onset when I chose to do it the diamond hands way, the autist with retard strength way.  **My Reason**  And while it's funny AF to be a part of this history (I bought shirts for my fiancee and her boyfriend, and I contributed to the commercial GoFundMe, and now I've even dusted off my Reddit account to get enough Karma to attempt a post on WSB), there's a deep source of my retard strength: Reason. No, not reason as in it is reasonable. Quite the opposite. I'm stubbornly unreasonable.  My Reason is that I bought in because I've also seen a lot of vampirism of the ultra wealthy on those who get by. I witness the parasites of Wallstreet hoover trillions during the aforementioned market events while the rest of us paid for it. I've seen student debt requirements and interest rates rise drastically all the while. I've seen the media bought and paid for and weaponized against us a hundred times over. I've seen money change hands for a pandemic relief that didn't relieve those truly in need of it. I've seen countless efforts by regular people to take away the controlling levers the ultra powerful use to prey on them squashed. Over and over and over again. I've said, ""It's not right, but it's the way of the world"" and, ""If you cannot beat them, join them"" tens of times if not hundreds. Be the world as it may, when something isn't right, you call it out for what it is. And sometimes, when you can, you devote a bit of your own small share of power to it. That's my Reason.  **I Hold.**  Don't waste your ""concern for me"", don't try to tell me about the ""next Reddit trade"", don't try to tell me that I should ""wait on a whale"" (news flash: this whole thing is happening because...Retail. Is. The. Whale.), or try to tell me about any of the other misinformation campaigns out there. Ultimately since the strength of the GME short squeeze relies on people holding, efforts by bots or shills--it makes no difference--to get those holding to sell are in essence advocating for the other side of the trade. Moon or die, I won't be on that side of this trade.  **""I HOLD."" -- me, every damn day since this started.**  In fact, I bought more yesterday during the dip.  ***TL;DR: I went into the trade with eyes wide open as a high risk, high reward trade. I usually don't take on these ""bets"", but this one resonated with me because of the vast amount of class injustice I've witnessed in my life. Doesn't sit right with me to either sit on the opposite side of this trade or on the sidelines. So I hold moon or die. Naysayers can GTFO of here.***  *Obligatory: I'm not a Financial advisor.

Ultimately since the strength of the GME short squeeze relies on people holding, efforts by bots or shills--it makes no difference--to get those holding to sell are in essence advocating for the other side of the trade. Moon or die, I won't be on that side of this trade.  **""I HOLD."" -- me, every damn day since this started.**  In fact, I bought more yesterday during the dip.  ***TL;DR: I went into the trade with eyes wide open as a high risk, high reward trade. I usually don't take on these ""bets"", but this one resonated with me because of the vast amount of class injustice I've witnessed in my life. Doesn't sit right with me to either sit on the opposite side of this trade or on the sidelines. So I hold moon or die. Naysayers can GTFO of here.***  *Obligatory: I'm not a Financial advisor.

72,My GME play.,2utes,"I have 255 shares @88. I was thinking of doing covered calls to make a $900 per contract on a March 26th $600 weekly. But then I asked myself a couple questions. 1. Who do I really make money from? Idiot retail investors or hedgies? 2. Will my 100 shares be borrowed to help hedgies? Could they pump and dump and fuck us over? Is it beyond the pale to think they wouldn't stoop to this level?   I decided that since you retards with your dd have stated the -8 beta etc and some other retards postulated that hedgies must sell off other positions to make up their losses that the best play IMO is to buy up all the stock and never place covered calls. Don't sell shares and patiently wait for the hedgies to sweat. I have a $360 call on March 26th. Whether ITM or OTM, I'm exercising that option. Drop the price more? I'll buy more. I'm not wasting my time on other ""meme"" stocks. That's their way of dividing our efforts to invest in gme. NFA, I'm a disabled vet who's retarded as fuuuuuuuuuuck.  TL/DR NFA only buying stocks.

54,Aphria Inc. (NASDAQ:APHA) Short Interest Down 22.3% in February,redrocketinn,"[source](   A lot of analysts are raising their target prices of APHA and also either already considered it a ""buy"" or changed from a ""hold"" to a ""buy"".  Short interest is down. I believe that's because hedge funds are exiting their short positions because they know something big is going to happen coming up. Either leading up to the merger date or on the merger date, and they don't want to be caught paying more than they have to when the price moons.  The shorts exiting also explains how the price got so low earlier this month and is lowering again today, possibly even lower.  Two important dates:  April 14, voting on the merger takes place  On or about April 20, the merger is completed  I would wait to see how low it gets today before buying in. It got as low as \~13 the last time Jpow spoke so it's worth waiting to see how low it can go so you can buy in. Regardless, if it stays around $20 ‚Äì $18, I personally would still buy in.  I believe APHA is going to moon after the voting confirms the merge, leading up to the merger date, or on or before the merger date. Either way something big is going to happen.  # Possible plays:  1. Buy in low and sell before the merger if you're satisfied with the gains. 2. Buy in low or high as long as APHA is 83.81% of a TLRY share. For this option it doesn't matter how the price is as long as APHA is still the cheaper of the two AND it's 83.81% of a TLRY share.  Why 83.81%  Every APHA share held through the merger will be turned into .8381 of a TLRY share. So for example:  100 APHA  20 TLRY  20 + (100 x .8381) TLRY = 103 TLRY  83 TLRY merged from 100 APHA would cost (@ current price \~$19.3): $1,601.9  83 TLRY bough directly as TLRY would cost (@ current price \~$25.5) : $2,116.5  So you save $514.6 by buying APHA instead.  That math is true no matter how high the price of either gets. If TLRY becomes more expensive and APHA stays around the same, even better. If APHA gets more expensive and TLRY stays the same, then obviously TLRY would be the best purchase if you plan to long the newly merged company.  &amp;#x200B;  IMO making sure APHA is below 83.81% before buying is good practice regardless of if you're short or long because it gives you options should you change your mind.  # TLDR; short interest down, probably in preparation for mooning on or around key dates (April 14, voting. April 20, merger). Buy low, sell high. If long, only buy if APHA is 83.81% of a TLRY. If short, do whatever the fuck you want.  This is not financial advice.",wallstreetbets,1,1615989021,m70uez

If APHA gets more expensive and TLRY stays the same, then obviously TLRY would be the best purchase if you plan to long the newly merged company.  &amp;#x200B;  IMO making sure APHA is below 83.81% before buying is good practice regardless of if you're short or long because it gives you options should you change your mind.  # TLDR; short interest down, probably in preparation for mooning on or around key dates (April 14, voting.

3,3/17/2021 GME Open Interest Report at Yesterday's Close of 208.14,Unlucky_Falcon1754,"I'M AN IDIOT. THIS IS JUST DATA THAT MAY BE USELESS. THIS ISN'T FINANCIAL OR LEGAL ADVICE. FOR ENTERTAINMENT PURPOSES ONLY. *See* Disclaimer at the End of Post.   **TL:DR:** **Buy GME this week for the POP next week.** As of yesterday's closing price of 208.14 and current open interest, 3.245 million shares are in-the-money for options expiring tomorrow. That is 6% of the entire inventory of GME shares out there. The pop will come next week when they will need to deliver on these shares by next Wednesday. The higher GME closes on Friday, the more it will hurt.   Summary:   1. Total Exposure to short positions on options is decreased slightly to **$2.5 billion** from $2.6 billion the day before--a 4% decrease. The share price went down by almost 6% so this is a slight **bullish** sign indicating that investors put  more money in ITM call options betting that the price will go up. *See* Figure 1 and Table 1.  2. Exposure for just the the options expiring Friday is **$889 million** down from $924 million--a 4% decrease**.** This is another slight **bullish** signal--they think it's going up by Friday. *See* Table 1.  3. The Number of Shares needed to cover all short positions on options decreased slightly to **11.6 million (21% of total float)** from 12.1 million (22% of float). *See* Figure 2 and Table 1.  4. The Number of Shares (or equivalents) needed to cover Friday's short option positions--alone--is relatively unchanged at **3.245 million (6% of total float)** down from 3.394 million (6% of float). *See* Table 1.  5. The ""Minimum Exposure Point"" for this Friday's options decreased to 150. *See* Table 2. This is a bearish sign in one sense because it indicates that our short positions on the options will do what they can to push the price to $150. This a bullish sign in a different sense because it indicates that money is going into calls such that the shorts on the options need to push the price lower to break even.   &amp;#x200B;  &amp;#x200B;              LIMITATIONS/WEAKNESSES/BACKGROUND:  This is the result of a thought experiment asking a simple question: If a hypothetical single actor/market maker was on the short side of all open options in GME, which means that he cannot simultaneously hold any long positions himself, what would that single actor's exposure be in terms of dollars? How many shares would that single actor need to find to cover all of the short positions?  Note that this does not represent this market maker's ""loss."" To sell an option, this hypothetical market maker received a premium as it does not take into account the premium the actor received for taking this short position.  Also, it also assumes that the actor has not already started purchasing/selling shares on the open market to cover short positions.  Finally, a major weakness of this curiosity is that, by its nature, it precludes the use of other long option positions to cover their short positions (since this hypo is set up with one guy being short on everything). In reality, we have multiple market makers who are constantly hedging themselves with other option contracts in the variety of neutral option strategies that exist for all options traders.",wallstreetbets,1,1615988403,m70mqw

80,A case for APHA,redrocketinn,"# Aphria Inc. (NASDAQ:APHA) Short Interest Down 22.3% in February - [source](   A lot of analysts are raising their target prices of APHA and also either already considered it a ""buy"" or changed from a ""hold"" to a ""buy"".  Short interest is down. I believe that's because hedge funds are exiting their short positions because they know something big is going to happen coming up. Either leading up to the merger date or on the merger date, and they don't want to be caught paying more than they have to when the price moons.  The shorts exiting also explains how the price got so low earlier this month and is lowering again today, possibly even lower.  Two important dates:  April 14, voting on the merger takes place  On or about April 20, the merger is completed  I would wait to see how low it gets today before buying in. It got as low as \~13 the last time Jpow spoke so it's worth waiting to see how low it can go so you can buy in. Regardless, if it stays around $20 ‚Äì $18, I personally would still buy in.  I believe APHA is going to moon after the voting confirms the merge, leading up to the merger date, or on or before the merger date. Either way something big is going to happen.  # Possible plays:  1. Buy in low and sell before the merger if you're satisfied with the gains. 2. Buy in low or high as long as APHA is 83.81% of a TLRY share. For this option it doesn't matter how the price is as long as APHA is still the cheaper of the two AND it's 83.81% of a TLRY share.   Why 83.81%  Every APHA share held through the merger will be turned into .8381 of a TLRY share. So for example:  100 APHA  20 TLRY  20 + (100 x .8381) TLRY = 103 TLRY  83 TLRY merged from 100 APHA would cost (@ current price \~$19.3): $1,601.9  83 TLRY bough directly as TLRY would cost (@ current price \~$25.5) : $2,116.5  So you save $514.6 by buying APHA instead.   That math is true no matter how high the price of either gets. If TLRY becomes more expensive and APHA stays around the same, even better. If APHA gets more expensive and TLRY stays the same, then obviously TLRY would be the best purchase if you plan to long the newly merged company.   &amp;#x200B;  IMO making sure APHA is below 83.81% before buying is good practice regardless of if you're short or long because it gives you options should you change your mind.   # TLDR; short interest down, probably in preparation for mooning on or around key dates (April 14, voting.

82,"Teradyne Inc DD, a stock with increasing online chatter",akokaz1,"Teradyne Inc, Ticker: **TER (+38% mentions)**  Market cap: $19.5Bn  Teradyne Inc supplies automation test equipment for semiconductors, wireless products, data storage and complex electronic systems in the consumer electronic, automotive, industrial, communications and aerospace sector.  Essentially, the chip powering the phone or laptop you are reading this from has most likely been tested by Teradyne.  Teradynes biggest customers include Samsung, Qualcomm, Nvidia, Intel, Boeing, Texas Instruments, 3M, and IBM.  Don‚Äôt have time to read the whole thing? I‚Äôll summarise below  3 main reasons why I like this stock:  * Overall semiconductor market future * Finances and balance sheet * Cathie Wood investment  2 possible downsides:  * Low future earnings forecasts * Recent price volatility  ### Future  Almost everything requires a semiconductor now, and that will only grow further in the future, some of the biggest examples are:  * The majority of mobile phones sold nowadays are smartphones, and while that growth has slowed down over the last few years, 1.5 billion a year are still sold. * The ecosystem surrounding mobile phones is growing rapidly, think tablets, smart watches, headphones, laptops, speakers. * Internet-of-things devices are booming, think Alexa, smart lighting, ovens, fridges,heating, mirrors etc. * Car technology (especially in electric cars) is mostly driven by semiconductor technology, shifting further and further away from analog technology * Gaming, from Playstations to VR headsets, again all require semiconductor technology * Automated manufacturing  Even without COVID, supply cannot keep up. There have been huge shortages this year for semiconductors causing pinches everywhere *(have you tried purchasing a PS5 recently?)* meaning lots of pent-up demand, even without, a number of HUGE factories have been built or will be built that are expected to ramp up supply. examples of those:  * [Samsung‚Äôs $17bn factory](  * [TSM‚Äôs $12bn plant](  * [Intel‚Äôs $7bn plant, completed in 2020](  * [List of all current fabrication plants to give you an idea of size of market](   All of this will require automation and testing.  Long-term, it‚Äôs very safe to assume that irrespective of economic or technological shifts, semiconductor demand will not only sustain, but surge. A few things on the horizon that will likely affect this:  * 5G technology being rolled out worldwide * Space technology &amp; tourism growth * AI &amp; data technology  The biggest kicker? Teradyne provide the majority of the automation and testing for all of these sectors, meaning any growth here only benefits them.  Furthermore, to me they are also proofed from the whole *‚Äúeconomy opening up means a move away from tech‚Äú* as it‚Äôs not like people will stop using electronic devices, unlike companies like Zoom which will see a big drop in usership as normality returns.  ### Finances  Even during a COVID year, Teradyne grew revenues from $2.29bn to $3.12bn, an increase of 36%.  They grew their net income even further, going from $467m to $784m, an increase of 67%.  &amp;#x200B;  [5 Year Net Income for Teradyne, rising from -$43m in 2016 to $784m in 2020. Return on Equity was 42.49&amp;#37;](   Earnings per share *(profit by number of shares)* also grew, from $2.6 to $4.28 (**+64%**) last year which is astounding. (*general consensus is anything above 25% growth is good).*  When taking the price of the stock into account, and looking at Price-to-Earnings ratio *(Price of the stock vs the earnings per share of a stock, the lower the better)* Teradyne has a PE ratio of 24.9x, which is way better than the industry average of 38x.  From a debt position, Teradyne is very healthy with an equity-to-debt ratio *(the lower the better, below 1 means more equity than debt)* of 0.18.  ### Cathie Wood Investment  Cathie Wood, the very aggressive bullish investor whos ETF [ARK Invest](  saw returns of 152% last year, [has recently purchased a further 139,619 shares](  to add to the current position.  Extra purchasing here shows long-term confidence, as this was added after ARK had to rebalance and sell some Teradyne shares last year.  ### Possible Downsides  Some analysts are predicting modest future revenue growth at 5.8%, compared to the industry average of 16.2%.  Furthermore, the price this year has seen some large volatility, suffering from the sell-off that affected technology and growth stocks earlier this year. If more sell-offs ensue, this could cause the price to drop further in the short term.  &amp;#x200B;  [Choppy price action for TER this year, dropping from all time highs of $148.](   ### Summary  Teradyne commands a large portion of a market that is only growing further every year. A financially healthy and well managed company, with high revenue and EPS growth, along with some strong investment backing. While there may be some volatility in the price of the stock short-term, long-term this company still has tremendous potential.",wallstreetbets,1,1615987299,m709l5

0,$CANF - Short Squeeze Opportunity,Sbl4ack,"      ## Can-Fite BioPharma (CANF):  Can-Fite BioPharma is an Israeli biopharmaceutical company with fully integrated drug discovery and clinical development capabilities. The company has advanced patented compound pipelines in the phase II and phase III clinical development phases, which can solve autoimmune inflammation and cancer diseases .  Sunfit Biopharmaceuticals‚Äô platform technology uses Gi protein-related A3 adenosine receptor (A3AR) as a therapeutic target. A3AR is highly expressed in inflammation and cancer cells, among which low expression is found in normal cells, indicating that this receptor may be a unique target for pharmacological intervention. The company compound binds to A3AR with nM affinity and initiates the deregulation of NF-Œ∫B and Wnt signal transduction pathways, thereby producing anti-inflammatory and anti-cancer effects.  Can-Fite BioPharma‚Äôs drug product line is a synthetic, highly specific agonist and allosteric modulator for A3AR. All drugs have oral bioavailability and excellent safety.  **Canfit Biopharmaceuticals‚Äô product candidates include:**  **1. CF101 (Piclidenoson)**¬†, the main drug candidate of Can-Fite, is currently in phase III clinical trials for the treatment of autoimmune inflammatory diseases, including rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and psoriasis. Can-Fite holds 82% of OphthaliX Inc. (OTCBB: OPLI), which develops CF101 for ophthalmic indications, including dry eye syndrome, glaucoma and uveitis.  Can-Fite has licensed CF101 to Cipher Pharmaceuticals in Canada, Gebro Pharma GmbH in Spain, Switzerland and Austria, and RA to Kwang Dong in South Korea to treat autoimmune diseases.  **2. CF102 (Namodenoson)**¬†, Can-Fite‚Äôs second drug candidate, is being developed for the treatment of liver cancer (primary liver cancer) and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease in the phase II clinical trial phase; also for the treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma And hepatitis C virus disease.  Can-Fite has authorized Chong Kun Dang Pharmaceut in South Korea to use CF102 to treat liver cancer.  **3. CF602**¬†, Can-Fite‚Äôs second-generation allosteric drug candidate for the treatment of inflammatory diseases, has proven this concept in in vitro and in vivo studies; it is currently in preclinical trials for the treatment of sexual dysfunction  Can-Fite has extensive clinical experience, including more than 1,200 patients participating in the company‚Äôs clinical trials.  Can-Fite BioPharma Ltd. and Icahn Medical College reached a cooperative research agreement on the treatment of liver disease.  &amp;#x200B;   **Can-Fite Biopharma** (NYSEAMERICAN:[**CANF**](  stock is on the rise Tuesday after announcing a $42.7 million deal with Ewopharma.   &amp;#x200B;     The first drug in the deal is Piclidenoson, which is used to treat psoriasis. It gives Ewopharma the exclusive market and distribution rights for the drug in Central Eastern European countries.  The deal also covers Namodenoson. This is a treatment for liver disease, including hepatocellular carcinoma and nonalcoholic steatohepatitis. The rights in this deal cover marketing and distribution in Central Eastern European countries and Switzerland.  The deal doesn‚Äôt stop there, either. It also allows for Ewopharma to extend its rights for these two drugs. That can happen if Can-Fite Biopharma discovers new uses for the treatments.  &amp;#x200B;  &amp;#x200B;  This sent the stock price to 4.30 yesterday creating a bull trap that dropped it to 2.77 pre-market. A lot of shorters are still in it trying to make it go down below 2.00. They will keeping shorting today creating an opportunity for them to get squeezed out.  &amp;#x200B;  The target price is 5$ on that and it will go higher when the company collects their royalties and the rest of the money from the deal.",wallstreetbets,1,1615986956,m705ib

GME lost more than 20 Points. Well technicaly yes, but as No: It was an unnatural drop from 232$ to 172$ which depleted the resources of the HFers, we should see some upward movement with a bit of turbulence the next days.  **HODL THE LINE I ‚ù§Ô∏è YOU APES** Once we have hitted our diamond support at 172$, most of you Apes BUY THE FKN DIP and I love you therefore!  **How come we still see those unnatural drops** Well as you now the HedgeFukers are dirty tricking basterds.

Will the Fed stop the music? Buy the rumor sale the news. We pushed thru and made another all-time high at 397.83 in the spy and promptly sold off thereafter. Can we push higher, is 400 in the cards today? No¬†matter what happens, I will not execute¬†any trades until after the fed speak. Also, be very¬†careful of the head fake¬†on the initial announcement. There is an obvious undertone in the broader market this Fed day; to Test and put pressure on the Fed by pushing rates higher and bond yields lower to see if the Fed will take action.¬†¬†The 3 outcomes to prepare for are:1) Can we hold the 390-support area if so, we could have a sharp move toward 397-400 looking to take action on the reversal that may happen between today or expiration Friday. 2) We Break support at 390 area, giving us a consolidation zone¬†between 397¬†and 390 before tanking toward the lower expected move of 386.96. 3) Down trend Day we try to close overnight gap toward 395 area before tanking toward the lower expected move of 386.96.   1) Can we hold the 393-support area if so, we could have a sharp move toward 397-400 looking to take action on the reversal that may happen between today or expiration Friday. **50% probability**   2) We Break support at 393 area, giving us a consolidation zone¬†between 397¬†and 390 before tanking toward the lower expected move of 386.96. **40% probability**   3) Down trend Day we try to close overnight gap toward 395 area before tanking toward the lower expected move of 386.96.¬†**10% probability**   Must keep and I on rates (tnx) could over heat market by rising sharply!

90,MARCH 17TH GME/AMC ANALYSIS/PREDICTION.,Asmosewins,"Okay, I'm doing this quick as fuck. It is currently an hour before open, so I want to get this out, and one before open ASAP.  AMC- MACD on all charts indicated we will see an immediate spike after premarket opens. This indicates an immediate dip at market open. A very good sign, dips are free tendies on amc.  GME- MACD shows a very healthy recover from yesterday's shitshow. I was bullish on today, but the stimmy and the current direction of MACD, I expect to blast off at premarket, and most likely continue up all day, unless we get hedgies painting the tape all day.  What to watch: RSI ON GME IS VERY HIGH BEFORE PREMARKET. This could be bad, or good. I hope we can keep bouncing off the 70, and stay above, this is going to squeeze them hard as fuck.   I believe AMC will be attacked today with painting the Hedges, sense we didn't see it yesterday, watch order book. If you see thousands of buy and sell amounts at the same volume such as 61,62,52,53 whatever the number. This will likely be a flat day, and destroy our momentum.   Thank you all!! See you on the moon, again sorry for providing any pictures or crayon drawings, but you can simply learn to read MACD yourself, go Google it and you'll be surprised what a smart ape you can be!!",wallstreetbets,1,1615985087,m6zkpf
95,(3/17) Wednesday's Pre-Market Stock Movers &amp; News,bigbear0083,"#Good morning traders and investors of the r/wallstreetbets sub! Welcome to Wednesday! Happy St. Paddy's Day! Here are your pre-market stock movers &amp; news on this Wednesday, March 17th, 2021-  *****  # [5 things to know before the stock market opens Wednesday](   *****  &gt; # 1. Dow futures steady as bond yields rise but Nasdaq futures fall  &gt; * Dow futures were steady Wednesday even as the 10-year Treasury yield jumped to a new 13-month high ahead of the Federal Reserve‚Äôs post-meeting release of new economic and interest rate projections and Chairman Jerome Powell‚Äôs news conference. However, Nasdaq futures slumped about 1%, in step with recent pressure when bond yields rise. The Dow Jones Industrial Average on Tuesday broke a seven-session winning streak, retreating from a record high close. The S&amp;P 500 also fell from a record close, breaking five straight days of higher finishes. The Nasdaq bucked Tuesday‚Äôs trend and finished higher.  *****  &gt; # 2. Powell needs to tamp down inflation concerns while defending policy  &gt; * As bond yields rise on concerns about inflation, Powell needs to convince traders that easy current Fed monetary policy won‚Äôt overheat a recovering economy that just got another Covid stimulus boost. Central bankers get a new batch of housing data to consider at 8:30 a.m. ET. Economists expect February housing starts to drop 2.5% following a 6% decline in January. Building permits for February are seen falling 7% after January‚Äôs 10.4% gain. The Fed concludes its two-day March meeting Wednesday afternoon, with no one expecting any change in rates from near zero or any shift in the extraordinary measures designed to support growth during the coronavirus pandemic.  *****  &gt; # 3. 15% of U.S. adults fully vaccinated; Trump touts shots to supporters  &gt; * New daily Covid cases in the U.S., down about 80% from early January, continued to fall as immunity protection increases from vaccinations and high levels of prior infection. More than 15% of the U.S. adult population has been fully vaccinated, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. However, while heading in the right direction, health officials say those vaccination numbers need to go much higher to stomp out the disease, which killed an average of 1,285 people in America over the past seven days, according to Johns Hopkins University data.  &gt; * Former President Donald Trump urged people to be vaccinated against the coronavirus, saying he would recommend it to ‚Äúa lot of people that don‚Äôt want to get it, and a lot of those people voted for me.‚Äù However, in a Fox News interview Tuesday night, Trump acknowledged that people were free to decide for themselves whether to get shots.  *****  &gt; # 4. White House sets low bar for Thursday‚Äôs U.S.-China meeting  &gt; * The White House is setting low expectations ahead of Secretary of State Antony Blinken and national security advisor Jake Sullivan‚Äôs first face-to-face meeting with their Chinese counterparts in Anchorage, Alaska, on Thursday. According to a senior Biden administration official, the two sides won‚Äôt deliver a joint statement and no major announcements are expected.  &gt; * Reflecting Washington‚Äôs concern about the erosion of Hong Kong‚Äôs rights, the U.S. sanctioned an additional 24 Chinese and Hong Kong officials over Beijing‚Äôs ongoing crackdown on political freedoms in the semi-autonomous city. China said the new sanctions expose America‚Äôs ‚Äúsinister intention to interfere in China‚Äôs internal affairs, disrupt Hong Kong and obstruct China‚Äôs stability and development.‚Äù  *****  &gt; # 5. Uber grants UK drivers worker status after losing labor battle  &gt; * Uber will reclassify all U.K.-based drivers as workers, in the wake of losing a major labor battle there earlier this year. Under the new designation, more than 70,000 drivers in the U.K. will get some benefits, including a minimum wage, holiday time and pension contributions. However, they won‚Äôt receive full employee benefits. In a SEC filing, Uber said its U.K. ride-hailing business accounted for 6.4% of all mobility gross bookings in the fourth quarter of 2020. Shares of Uber fell more than 2% in U.S. premarket trading.  *****  #STOCK FUTURES CURRENTLY: ######(**[CLICK HERE FOR STOCK FUTURES CHARTS!](   *****  #YESTERDAY'S MARKET MAP: ######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S MARKET MAP!](   *****  #TODAY'S MARKET MAP: ######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S MARKET MAP!](   *****  #YESTERDAY'S S&amp;P SECTORS: ######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S S&amp;P SECTORS CHART!](   *****  #TODAY'S S&amp;P SECTORS: ######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S S&amp;P SECTORS CHART!](   *****  #TODAY'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR: ######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR LINK #1!](  ######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR LINK #2!](   *****  #THIS WEEK'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR: ######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR!](   *****  #THIS WEEK'S UPCOMING IPO'S: ######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S UPCOMING IPO'S!](   *****  #THIS WEEK'S EARNINGS CALENDAR: ######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S EARNINGS CALENDAR!](   *****  #THIS MORNING'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS CALENDAR: ######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS MORNING'S EARNINGS CALENDAR!](   *****  #EARNINGS RELEASES BEFORE THE OPEN TODAY: ######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS MORNING'S EARNINGS RELEASES!](   *****  #EARNINGS RELEASES AFTER THE CLOSE TODAY: ######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS AFTERNOON'S EARNINGS RELEASES LINK!](   *****  #YESTERDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES: ######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES LINK #1!](  ######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES LINK #2!](  ######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES LINK #3!](   *****  #YESTERDAY'S INSIDER TRADING FILINGS: ######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S INSIDER TRADING FILINGS LINK #1!](  ######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S INSIDER TRADING FILINGS LINK #2!](   *****  #TODAY'S DIVIDEND CALENDAR: ######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S DIVIDEND CALENDAR LINK #1!](  ######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S DIVIDEND CALENDAR LINK #2!](   *****  #THIS MORNING'S STOCK NEWS MOVERS:  ######(**source: [cnbc.com](   *****  &gt; **Lands‚Äô End (LE)** ‚Äì The apparel retailer reported quarterly earnings of 60 cents per share, topping the 56 cents a share consensus estimate.

97,Why I sold all my CRSR yesterday morning.,Franticalmond2,"Had a turtle beach headset for my Xbox for 5 + years. Thing sounded great and was sturdy as a fuckin rock. Even snapped in half once after I accidentally sat on it. Duct taped that bitch back together and used it for another 2 years.   Well it finally reached the end of its lifecycle in January, so being a reasonable ape who owns CRSR stock I purchased one of the HS60 headsets to support my homies. Sound quality was good and overall I liked it. But when I started playing with some of my friends, they kept telling me they could hear my game sound. Weird. Two nights ago, I finally did a test by completely covering the microphone and pressing the volume up button on my headset in order to cause it to make a little tone to notify that it was at max volume. And yep, everyone heard that loud and clear in my party. So this stupid thing transmits my game sound as voice chat....  So I go to warranty the thing, and it fucking turns out that Corsair doesn‚Äôt even do refunds. The best you can get is a replacement after playing some little song and dance with them for shipping (which you also pay for). All of this has to be done directly through Corsair.  Fuck that shit. Sold all my CRSR and bought another Turtle Beach headset üê¢üèù  Positions: sell all CRSR",wallstreetbets,1,1615984948,m6zj8w

GME lost more than 20 Points. Well technicaly yes, but as No: It was an unnatural drop from 232$ to 172$ which depleted the resources of the HFers, we should see some upward movement with a bit of turbulence the next days.  *HODL THE LINE I ‚ù§Ô∏è YOU** Once we have hitted our diamond support at 172$, most of you Apes did **[BUY THE FKN DIP](  and I love you therefore!  **SSR** I know, we described this thing 100 of times. It‚Äôs just for the new folks here. It means Short Selling Restrictions, which prohibits selling shorts at an lower price than the current market buy price. This ‚Äúshould‚Äù prevent the stock from dropping too much and is triggered for one day, if the stock has deprecated more than 10% in value! And SSR are now up since last Thursday.  **How come we still see those unnatural drops** Well as you now the HedgeFukers are dirty tricking basterds. They are buying every day tons of Long Positions and placing massive sell orders once their long positions hit an target. It seems they have built up an massive sell wall of those long positions at 220$ and 250$.   **Pre-Market Update 1:**  Germany is quiet, not too much movement, too quiet. As we know from history every moment before the great battle, has quiet surroundings as fuk. GME started at 215$ and lost 13$ in the Pre-Market, the price is hovering an bit over the significant 200$ line. Shorts borrowing fee is at an record low with 0.7%, this suggests that the Shitters have reserved the right for very much shorting positions, which we apparently cannot see.  Shorts available: we can only see 400.000  Current Pre-Market Price: 205$  **Yesterday** Yesterday I‚Äôve done an Apedate on AMC and promised an giveaway if AMC reaches 16$ EOD, which apparently did not happen.

20,UWMC Addendum Update,HainsBeans,"UWMC Ultimatum Update  Hello apes. Before calling me a Cramer cronie or a shill bot - I am in on GME. I like the stock and will not sell until it reaches at least $42069. Obligatory üöÄüöÄ  Now to the meat:   Detroit news published an article advising that UWMC ‚Äòmissed 80% of their brokers‚Äô. Meaning that by the addendum ultimatum on 15/3 they did not reach their target. Nevertheless, here is a breakdown as per the source about how many brokers are on board/declined/have yet to respond.  ‚ÄúThe 4,600 brokers who worked with UWM and Rocket or Fairway had until Monday night to agree to an addendum to keep working with UWM. About 3,000 accepted; UWM declined to provide a list of names. Roughly 400 brokers declined the addendum, and another 1,200 have not responded.‚Äù  And:  ‚ÄúNot responding doesn‚Äôt mean they didn‚Äôt commit ‚Äî we‚Äôre still in communication with those who haven‚Äôt accepted or some clients are out of town, and it would be a vastly poor assumption to think that all those who have yet to accept won‚Äôt accept,"" the spokesperson said in a statement.  ""We expect about 50% of the undecided will accept, but regardless, out of the 12,000 clients we have, about 85%+ will be all in with UWM.""  Source:     TL;DR: 65% of independent brokers are confirmed with signing the deal. 1200 have yet to decide but CEO believe more than 50% will (seems reasonable).

80,A theory on why the ghost of Saint Patrick is helping us.,Lord_Cabbage_the_5th,"On Paddy's day I think it is vitally important for us to stop and ponder the real possibility that the ghost of St. Patrick himself is helping us in our war against the hedgies.   Let's look at some FACTS:  1. Just like WSB users, the Irish were long looked at as the apes of Europe by wealthier nations. [Proof](   2. Originally kidnapped and brought to Ireland before gaining his freedom, Saint Patrick returned to help the Irish apes from Wales, a term commonly used to describe mega wealthy investors or investor groups. [A BBC news story about a whale sighting off the coast of Wales.](   3. He banished the snakes from ireland, just like how WSB wants to banish the shnakey actions of the hedgefunds from the stock exchanges of the world. [Recently discovered artists impression of St. Patrick](   4. As St. Patrick lived in the pre-electricfication era its safe to assume that he used CANDLES, we can also hypothesise that GREEN was his favourite colour based on his association with the colour. What does this mean? One thing; Saint Patrick was enamoured with GREEN CANDLES. [Another famous artwork of St. Patrick, notice anything?](   Conclusion: It is clearly evident that the Ghost of Saint Patrick has returned yet again from Wales to banish the snakes and bring green candles for all his apes.  Bonus bet: It is commonly believed that he flourished in the 5th century and died March 17th 461CE. If the stock reaches 461$ EOW I will record myself dressed as Saint Patrick throwing jelly snakes into the sea while eating a green candle.",wallstreetbets,1,1615982996,m6yzbv

98,Insane DD on why the GME-squeeze inevitable and how the HFs dug their own graves by banking on a bankruptcy jackpot,SteveCookMarryMe,"**All credits go to /u/Gafgarian** for creating this really insightful and borderline autistic DD.  The DD-PDF can be found **here**:      I think /u/rensole described the PDF well:   ""The DD is in the form of a PDF consisting of 31 easy to read slides.  it shows that the FTD's are in a cyclical nature, how much float is left in total (about 19.3 Million shares). it go's into the risk model it go's into everything.   The HFs banked on the bankruptcy jackpot this means that they bet on the fact that gamestop would go under, destroying the spring and giving them all the tendies, but because Ryan Cohen stepped in this became impossible, also with the digital transition and the positive public sentiment this one is now off the table.  so check the pdf because this stuff is rainman levels of detailed.  to me this shows me that the FTD's are more cyclical in nature, meaning they use Short A to short normally, then they can't find a good share to cover this so what do they do? right they Short again (creating short B), so they use short B to cover the debt of short A, then they short again (creating short C) and they cover short B.... you guys seeing a pattern here?""",wallstreetbets,1,1615982506,m6yuam

Being I'm a parent with an Autistic child, I thought I would mention this.  My son is socially awkward, yet has a heart of gold. Watching him grow up has been an amazing journey. Every autistic child is different from the rest, no two are alike. As he progressed through school I was surprised to see he had a special talent for math and science. We decided when he was young that we would school him through Connections Academy (online school). Why? because we know that other people (kids) can be mean. We didn't want to subject him to that. He has flourished! He isn't ""slow"" or retarded, he just sees the world in a different way than you and me. If you ever run into him on XBox..... you wouldn't know he's autistic. He will more than likely piss you off as he beats you over and over. Yes, he has a knack for video games as well. Every day he comes down to my computer and tells me some new information about this game and that. Spends a lot of time researching all the gaming news. So, in short I just wanted to share this with you all. I'm proud of my son, I love my son.  Now if you all want another worthy cause...... Autism Speaks [ ",wallstreetbets,1,1615982119,m6yqev

22,Trade Idea - If we see a green market and the fed doesnt hint at raise of rates huge catalyst for - PRTS! Also wrote a post yesterday on PRTS,UltimateTraders,"Today‚Äôs Play  CarParts PRTS  I wrote a special post yesterday highlighting just a few of the key reasons for PRTS. This post honestly, is catered to the WSB crowd of 9.5 million members. That post pretty much sums this up. This has also been the play before. This company has gone from overall sales in 2019 of 280 million to 2020 443 Million. This company used to lose a lot of money, and have negative cash flows. During the pandemic the company had positive quarters and started to make money. Is this turn around complete? That is the question, however we are still in a pandemic and at least for the next 1-2 quarters people are home and ordering carparts online. On the WSBNew some redditors even commented they also have just started to use the service please check the post on WSBNEW. I believe 3 of them out of maybe 8 comments. The sentiment and PRTS during the pandemic says that the tune may have changed and the business will flourish. However, if you know me, I like to have facts and don‚Äôt do if, and hope‚Ä¶ so I will say for the next 1-2 quarters they should crush it‚Ä¶. Analysts are predicting about 50% sales growth‚Ä¶.last quarter was 100%!!!! 100%%%!!!!???!!! That is insane. Now, I do not work at the company so I cant say of course if it is closer to 50 or closer to 100%. I can only tell you that year over year it has been 70%.....last quarter was 100%.... they have picked up steam‚Ä¶ and if it is closer to 100% rather than their 50% this is once again going to be a huge beat!  PRTS is heavily shorted‚Ä¶.Anything above 15% is heavily shorted. My guess, and this is my guess is that people saw a stock thatwas $1‚Ä¶.. went to $23 and said lets short!!! They did not pay attention. Yes, I did see the stock under $5 and did not buy‚Ä¶because if you know me I rather pay more when the company finally executes and has proven they have grown into the valuation, then speculate and hope it moons. I do not guess, I wait for the company to execute before testing. I started trading this near $10‚Ä¶Many‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶..Many‚Ä¶.Many Times‚Ä¶.. I decided at $18 to rich for my blood‚Ä¶ and just entered back in $15-16.  PRTS is a 700 million dollar company that has really started to knockout numbers. There are many players in this field far larger, Oreillys, Autozone, Pep boys‚Ä¶. It is a bonus that this is so cheap, shorted and could be a primary target!!!!  Good luck and lets make money.

61,Why GME's negative beta is meaningless and tells us nothing one way or the other about whether the shorts have covered,Beartholomew,"TLDR: GME's negative beta doesn't mean anything, it's caused by the stock's huge increase from December to January and the way that beta is calculated.  This is a response to [a post claiming that GME's negative beta is evidence that the shorts have not covered](  On the face of it, this isn't the stupidest thing that I read today, but it seemed like a reach at best: &gt; About GME specifically &gt;  &gt; Here is the historical beta of GME: &gt;  &gt; 02/28/2021 -2.195 &gt;  &gt; 12/31/2020 1.404 &gt;  &gt; 09/30/2020 1.084 &gt;  &gt; 06/30/2020 1.038 &gt;  &gt; 03/31/2020 0.4512 &gt;  &gt; You can see that GME's beta has only been negative since end of Feb 2021. Before that it had a very normal beta of over 1, meaning when the market was doing well, then its business did well too, i.e. people have money to spend on games, etc. Even during most of the lockdown its beta was still quite a bit above 1. But at the end of Feb, it suddenly went all the way down to -2.195. What happened at that time? The massive crash down to $38. Plotkin himself said that the rapid rise in price was not due to shorts covering right? But have they covered since one way or the other? The beta would indicate no because now the beta is even lower, at -2.09. Since Yahoo confirms Nasdaq, I think the FT is sus and in the best case just doesn't update its data. -1.7413 is still remarkable though.  &gt;[...]I don't know how the beta is calculated by these news outlets but I think it must be done automatically by the bots and even if FT were a shill and not simply inaccurate, the beta of -1.7413 is still crazy.  What struck me, however, is that GME's beta supposedly didn't go negative until February. Wasn't GME shorted to shit well before February? Why would beta only plunge in February? The worst part, though, is that the commentary reveals that the writer of the original DD (u/animasoul) didn't look into how beta is calculated. How are you going to start attributing meaning to a number without understanding where it comes from?  So I looked into how beta is calculated, and sadly GME's negative beta is entirely meaningless, an artifact caused by an outlier. Here's what do you need to know:  1) Beta is easy to calculate. You can do it yourself with Excel following [these steps](    2) The beta reported by Yahoo Finance et al is calculated using only 36 monthly data points. This is not very many, which means the calculation can be skewed by outliers fairly easily.  3) There is a [HUGE OUTLIER in January that wrecks the whole calculation](  This is why the beta suddenly went negative in February. Basically, when looking at monthly pricing, GME went up 1625% from December to January, while the benchmark went down -1%. This completely warps the beta calculation but wasn't caused by any kind of shorting activity, because the offending data point is one where GME's stock price is RISING, while the market is falling. If you remove this outlier, [GME's beta is POSITIVE 1.58](  If the market had risen 1% instead of falling 1% that month, [GME's beta would have been 1.06](   Long story short, GME's negative beta isn't a story about whether or not the shorts have covered, it's a story about a stock going to the moon (+1625%) in a month when the rest of the market went down slightly (-1%) and how that single data point warped the 36 month average because the stock's upward movement was so pronounced. The stock's beta will likely remain negative for three years, until the outlier falls out of the 36 month calculation period. While the outlier was caused by the gamma/short squeeze, since then, none of this has anything to do with whether the stock is currently being shorted, or whether the shorts are covering.  Anyone with a spreadsheet and an internet connection could have come to this same conclusion, so do a little research before believing everything you read, even if it's long, supports your preconceptions, and ends with diamond hand emojis.",wallstreetbets,1,1615980816,m6ye4p

71,WHY I THINK THE GME SHORT INTEREST IS MUCH HIGHER THAN 337.22% ? (ZACK's DD 2),ZACKGME-SH,"I am not here for your upvotes (those upvotes mean nothing to me)! I need you to understand you have gained the big support even from the distant CHINA, a nation whose people good at math!!!  \-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  [   1. FINRA is the source where I got the data. As for me, FINRA is the only source I can trust partially. It works together with SEC to govern the US trade market fairly. 2. I will trace back to the SI data from the middle of January, and make the calculation to prove my conclusion: The true SI of GME is definitely higher than **337.22%**!  &amp;#x200B;  *Processing img 0x3m2ub4qkn61...*  This is the screenshot of GME SI from FINRA when I first do GME DDs. Look at the date: 02/02/2021, and look at the SI: 226.42% !  3. [   Through this website, we can know the settlement date of the FINRA report:  &amp;#x200B;     The settlement date of this ""226.42%"" FINRA report should be 1/15/2021.  4. I take the trade figure from the FINRA website to monitor the price change as well as the trade volume. Here it goes:  &amp;#x200B;  *Processing img s69bs128qkn61...*  5. So the upper half represents the GME stock price, and the lower part represents the corresponding trade volume. From the late January to Feb 1, the price increase didn't show up with the volume increase! Hence, this was merely little gamma squeeze, definitely NOT SHORT SQUEEZE and NOT SHORT POSITIONS CLOSING!!!  6. When 'closing short positions' happens, there must be stock price skyrocket together with trade volume drastically increase!!! KEEP IN MIND THIS! VERY VERY IMPORTANT!!! According to this concept, the middle January can be a tiny closing of short positions.  7. Look at the trade volume from Feb 22 to Mar 16, do we see any 'stock price skyrocket together with trade volume drastically increase'? The answer is NO! NO! NO! Even with tiny price increase together with trade volume increase, those trade volume won't provide enough GME stock to completely close their short positions!  For example, one of the 'stock price skyrocket together with trade volume drastically increase' can be Feb 2, 2021; Here is the figure, but the trading volume is too low for the HFs to completely close their short positions!  &amp;#x200B;  *Processing img jtyduk2aqkn61...*  8. Another way to prove that HFs are not closing their short positions:  [  (collected by [u/RealPayTheToll](   [   I captured some data from FINRA website to get the daily short volume and their percentage. Here is the summarized data from Jan 15 to Mar 16.  &amp;#x200B;     *Processing img 643ozozbqkn61...*  Pay attention to the ""% short"",when the percentage is higher than 50%, nevertheless what the exact short positions increase per day, it means the HFs were shorting more and more GME stocks, and by no chance will they cover their short positions these days!  Even when the exact short positions increase per day is only 'one' share, the final short interest will be higher than 226.42%!  This means: If you owed the bank 1000 USD at Jan 15, 2021. And from then on, you keep borrowing 1USD (or whatever higher than 0 USD) from the bank. Hence, by now, you owed the bank more than 1000 USD. THIS IS THE CASE!  \--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  Now I will show you how to calculate the float short interest rather than the short interest!  GME total shares: 69,750,000 , calculated as 70 M ;  GME free float shares: 46,920,000 ,calculated as 47M ;  \-----------------------------------  The Short Interest calculation formula is as follows:  Short Interest = Shorts shares / Total shares \* 100  226.42% = Short shares / 70 M  Short shares = 158.494 M  \-----------------------------------  The Float Short Interest calculation formula of GME is as follows:  Float Short Interest = Short shares / Free float shares \* 100%  Bring in the data:  Float Short Interest = 158.494 M / 47 M \* 100% = 337.22%  \-----------------------------------  I think the HFs didn't start to short the ETFs as early as Jan 15, 2021. So, the true SI of GME should be much higher than 337.22% by now! This circumstance did take the ETFs shorting into consideration. And by Jan 15, 2021, the HFs didn't realize the danger of retail investors, hence the motivation of them cheating the FINRA is lower than now. This data should be more trustful compared with recent data!  \-----------------------------------  Note: I am not a financial advisor. This article does not constitute any investment advice.

The settlement date of the report is FEB-26-2021 and does not include the short selling volume to date of FEB-26-2021.  &amp;#x200B;     Here we can use the mathematical calculation to calculate the SI of GME.  The FINRA SI of GME is 52.04% by the end of FEB-26-2021.(THIS DATA IS REPORTED BY THE HFs THEMSELVES, THEY WILL SURELY CHEAT AND WILL ONLY BE FINED FOR THAT)  1. The FINRA report is as follows: 2. [   &amp;#x200B;     The FINRA report is updated every semimonthly, and the updated data are summarized by FINRA and published in the following 8-9 days.  [   2. Here comes the calculation  The latest FINRA report shows that the top 10 institutions hold 140.70 M, TOTAL INSTITUTIONAL OWNERSHIP accounting for about 201.73% of the total equity of GME. (LOOK!!! THERE ARE MORE THAN 10 INSTITUTIONS!!! EVEN MAYBE 100 OR 1000)  The GME held by the top 10 funds is about 23.35M, TOTAL FUND HOLDING accounting for 33.48% of the total equity of GME. (AGAIN, MORE THAN 10 FUNDS HOLDING!!!)  &amp;#x200B;           As suggested by [desertrock62](  RC Ventures 9M has been repeatedly calculated, here I remove this data.  The total number of these TWO types of shareholdings is : (M is short for million, million)  140.70 M + (23.35M-9M) = 155.05 M  GME FLOAT SHARES: 69,750,000 , calculated as 70 M ;  GME FREE FLOAT SHARES: 46,920,000 ,calculated as 47M ;  Q: The number of total outstanding shares is only 70 M, so where did these additional 85.05M shares come from?  Synthetic or shadow GME stocks sold by HFs through shorting will be bought by retail investors and bulls, so B who bought the shadow stock and A who lent the stock claimed ownership of the stock at the same time, which will lead to double counting of the same stock.  The total number of shares held MUST BE HIGHER THAN 155.05M, which is calculated on the basis of shorting the same GME stock and selling once (if the same stock is shorted multiple times, the SI will be even higher). The number of stocks that short sellers need at least Short:  155.05M ‚Äì 70 M = 85.05 M  The Float Short Interest calculation formula of GME is as follows:  Float Short Interest = Short shares / Free float share \* 100%  Bring in data:  Float Short Interest = 85.05 M / 47M \* 100% = 180.96%  This means that at least 1.8 times the number of outstanding shares is needed to close the position.

I've lurked on here for a couple weeks now and it has been an endless supply of fantastic content.  Not just for the shit talk, not just for the memes and videos, but also for what is obviously a great community full of good people who put their money to good use rather than horde it like the fat kitties on Wall Street.

15,Will the ETFs that contain GME recall units loaned to short sellers before rebalancing?,NathanielA,"For those of you who have been living under a rock, short sellers have been trying to push GME into the ground.  In late January during stage 1 of the squeeze, the hedgies raided a certain ETF, which lost 80% of its assets as outflows to the shorts that just wanted the GME shares tied up in ETF units.  This gave the hedgies enough GME to cover their positions without using up all the float and exacerbating the squeeze.  But as we all know by now, the story didn't end there.  Hedge funds that still have a lot on the line have continued to short GME, doubling down in desperation to keep the price low, to avoid margin calls, gamma squeeze, and ultimately the Mother of All Short Squeezes.  While trying to short every possible source of GME, the hedge funds continued shorting ETFs, that one ETF in particular, with every unit in the float shorted multiple times over.  One of the things we've been hoping for is that our special ETF is going to recall the units it loaned to short sellers before it rebalances this Friday.  You see, our special ETF is supposed to be evenly distributed among many different stocks.  But with the recent rise in GME's price, GME is now overrepresented.  When the ETF rebalances on Friday, it is going to sell most of its GME and buy more of everything else.  As far as I can tell, two things can happen:  1. The ETF does not recall its loaned units.  ETF sells GME, GME's price goes down.  Shorts close their positions using newly rebalanced ETF units that contain only a fraction of the GME they once held. 2. The ETF does recall its loaned units.  Shorts are forced to scramble for GME to reconstitute the ETF units they sold, starting a short squeeze, pushing all of our calls ITM, triggering a gamma squeeze, and the MOASS.  The ETF can then sell the GME itself, getting a much better price for it, and therefore it is able to buy more of the other stocks it holds.  I know what I want the ETF to do, but I wonder if the ETF has other motivations.  Also, I have no money and I don't know anything at all about the stock market, so maybe the two possibilities I listed above make no more sense than an ape grunting, and I'm just embarrassing myself.  Either way, I'd really like to hear what you think is going to happen ahead of the rebalancing on Friday.",wallstreetbets,1,1615978634,m6xta4
22,Some Food for Thought,Spliff4Breakfast,"    Hello, fellow apes,  This isn‚Äôt financial advice, I‚Äôm a dumb ape yada yada yada.  This isn‚Äôt DD either‚Ä¶  My hope with this post is to try and make the world a better place, for people that are either involved in the MOASS or not.  The world has been a dark place for a while, the gap between the rich and the working class has been getting bigger and bigger by the day, you don‚Äôt need to be a normal human with a wrinkly brain to see that.  The squeeze is pretty much inevitable at this point, provided we all buy and hold the stock. A lot of people stand to make a lot of money on this and I‚Äôm sure some of us, even if it is a small percentage, will turn into rich assholes. It's human nature given the number of people involved in this.  I‚Äôm seeing a lot of good things on this sub as of recently, #ApesAdoptingApes, and numerous other charitable donations. This is proving that money is going into the right hands, and that‚Äôs what the world needs.  When this squeezes and millions/billions are made, support charities, support local businesses, support start-ups that you believe in. Invest in businesses that you think can make a difference to the world *on top of what you think would make you some extra bananas.* üçåüçåüçå  I genuinely think that this could be a turning point for the economy as a whole. And the general ethics of people with the capital to make a difference. The 1% has been known to be trash for a while and pretty much all I‚Äôm saying is #BeABetterOnePercent.

Since Saturday, the Dian Fossey Gorilla Fund, dedicated to protecting gorillas, has received a groundswell of donations from an unlikely source: investors on a Reddit forum, WallStreetBets, better known in national news for boosting the stock price of GameStop(GME). They donated more than $330,000 to the Georgia nonprofit as of Tuesday morning, with the tally still growing. ""We were surprised, thrilled and appreciative when we first heard that the WallStreetBets community was investing in our work,"" Tara Stoinski, the organization's chief executive and chief scientific officer, wrote in an email to The Atlanta Journal-Constitution. ""This is a huge deal to our organization."" WallStreetBets became a central forum for investors taking on hedge funds that had bet against video game retailer GameStop(GME) and other companies by shorting their stock. The Reddit movement helped put GameStop's(GME) share price on a rollercoaster, with stunning peaks and sharp falls. Investors banding together on the site sometimes refer to themselves as apes, apparently a reference to the line ""Apes together strong,"" from the movie Rise of the Planet of the Apes. Recently, a member of WallStreetBets highlighted one of the Fossey nonprofit's fundraising efforts, the symbolic adopting of a gorilla. Others joined in. In less than 48 hours, the Fossey organization received more than 2,000 new adoptions. In a typical weekend it might normally get 20. The giving has continued. The nonprofit focuses on conservation and study of gorillas in Rwanda and the Democratic Republic of the Congo. It is named after Dian Fossey, a researcher who wrote the book ""Gorillas in the Mist."" She was later murdered in her cabin in Rwanda. Her story was made into a movie starring Sigourney Weaver. The organization had $6.7 million in revenue in 2019. It's been raising funds for construction of a research and education campus set to open this year in Rwanda.\\  I want to say this is a beautiful thing you retards are doing. Just yesterday I maxed out my interday buying power to buy GME on the dip. Its not going to be easy but if we can come together to raise money for our fellow Apes then we can shit on this hedge funds.",wallstreetbets,1,1615977192,m6xgvh

57,ZYNE - the rocket taking weed to the moon üöÄüöÄ,dopestloser,"# Zynerba Pharmaceuticals Inc (ZYNE)  Weed isn‚Äôt going anywhere, the political tide is turning in the US, and the weed money is running a slight lag behind the GME/AMC spikes.  ZYNE has seen outsized increases in the recent activity in the market ‚Äì jumps of up to 49% on March 15, and 51% Feb 10. Their MA have all turned bullish with the exception of 10D due to its recent peak. The long term averages are all showing buy.  The only weed stock which has performed similarly is TLRY, but there is some [ongoing legal activity](  re their merger documents with APHA. I'm too dumb to know what that's about but it makes my bumhole pucker.  Further, if the merger went ahead one APHA share is worth 0.83 TLRY shares post merger. If you were to take the view that these legal issues are not an issue at all, APHA is still the better option. Current price APHA $20.22 equals 75% of TLRY at $26.97 making it of higher value post-merger.  &amp;#x200B;  **The business**   ZYNE specialize in neuropsychiatric conditions, and at [least 91% of Americans](   think cannabis should be legal for medical reasons at least. This positions ZYNE to take advantage of the broadest spectrum of the population with respect to public acceptability. ZYNE uses a transdermal gel, ensuring more bioavailability and avoids any potential issues with the likes of an upset stomach.  **Downsides:** Non psychoactive, so you‚Äôll need to go elsewhere next time you‚Äôre having a night in playing Forknife with your wife's boyfriend.  **Political climate**  *Disclaimer: I‚Äôm not from the US and I don‚Äôt give a fuck which team you‚Äôre on. This is the tide changing via the government of the day*  Only [8 states](  have cannabis illegal in all manners   Even more states are coming around. [Virginia](  [New York](  [Arizona](  have all progressed recently. In total [five](  states voted for progressive cannabis legislation in 2020  While the golden ticket is full federal legalization, it‚Äôs not going to happen overnight. The first big jump will come from the incoming [SAFE Act](   which will allow the cannabis sector access to the banking system. Alas apologies to the ex marines who may not have the job carrying [bags of cash](   but ease of **doing business** makes a better business.  Internationally [Mexico](  [New Zealand](   and [Europe](  are softening their stances on cannabis also  TLDR: Weed is going to the moonüåï, and ZYNE is the Falcon Heavy üöÄ shooting us there.

4,Stretch Crazy,jfetterman90,"I have read some crazy theories on this forum throughout the recent GME chaos and I fucking love it tbh. I never really used Reddit in the last (fucking dumb move on my part obviously) but my god this it is fun to read and lurk on. You are some wild fucks and I dig it. That being said, I figured I would be a complete leach if I didn‚Äôt at least try to add some of my crazy (as a hopeful thank you) just in case it actually works out as I see it in my Autistic Ape-like brain so here it is....  For quite a while now, like most of you fuckin losers, I‚Äôve found myself quite isolated and bored throughout the pandemic and tbh even before it and I went down the YouTube doc/lecture/random talks rabbit hole and from what I‚Äôve learned I legit think that this whole GME/AMC/BB/NOK game that we are all fucking around with may be just one small piece to a plan to break the stifling beaurocratic* processes throughout the established/outdated system that true innovators have struggled with for centuries.  Again, this is stretch fucking crazy BUT with the way the FED is printing money and playing with the bond yields throughout this extremely volatile stonk trading while also basically neglecting its implications makes me think that it is exactly what they want to happen (hopefully). IMHO the world is fucked in so many ways rn and our most effective tool to fix the problems we face is based in science and innovative technologies that complement each other in an exponential fashion (AI/Machine Learning).  I truly believe that the Meme stonk revolution was orchestrated by a benevolent group of people that saw how broken our current market system is and found an opportunity to destroy it and replace it with a system more aligned with being one of those complementing innovative technologies to be used for an overall improvement of current outdated systems and the world.

The Stock price crashed from \~$60 to $4, but has since recovered quickly to $45 now, which I think is still undervalued by several factors.   The Company (Maxar Techologies) consists of several branches which joined together in early 2017: Space Systems (manufacturing of Space equipment) , Digitalglobe (Satellite imagery), Radiant (Geospatial analytics), MDA (independent Canadian part of the business: Robotics, Space sensors etc.) and has since been taken over by a new highly competent CEO.  Read here an interview with the CEO Dan Jablonsky about Worldview-Legion, which will be their new constellation of imagery satellites scheduled for launch in early 2021. Right now Capex is high due to this project but this will drive tremendous free cash flow if successful. Margins on their imagery results are 60.5%!

But looking past the money, when we get to the end of this, America will really become the land of the FREE! Imagine. A life with no student loans, no mortgage, and no car notes. Nothing Other than excitement for the coming day keeping you up at night. To be truly Free! This is what this war is about.           Big banks have lured many into their illusion of freedom enslaving many for generations; we have seen now that they control the media so our narrative on freedom have been scripted to their benefit. But the tides are turning! Technology has shone a BRIGHT light in the darkness they have kept us in for centuries. And now it is UP TO US TO DO WHAT IS NECESSARY to reclaim our freedom. WE BUY, AND WE MOTHER FUCKING HOLD!!!    Think about it. Why do you think they are fighting so hard? They know that losing this war will break open the flood gates which they have put in place to control our progress. They also know that this war will usher in A NEW ERA!  One where we will see currency FULLY decentralized, monopolistic capitalist strongholds crumble and be replaced with a more human centric, and earth conscious leaders. One where humanity can truly shine forth (we seen so Many examples of humanitarian acts just off the little gains we‚Äôve seen so far) and address issues of our planet. Hedgies are fighting so hard because in this new world, they would be punished for all their crimes against humanity. So they are fighting for their lives!! But this is an uphill battle for them that is slowly coming to a devastating and climatic END!     Now knowing what is at stake here, and knowing what you have to do to create that future for yourself and for your legacy, I HOPE YOU ARE AS AMPED UP AS I AM!!  I have been through so much uncertainty in my life. So much hardship. But what has kept me going is the belief that there is a light at the end of the tunnel And giving up now only means I will never get to see that light. Using that mindset in this war, I SEE THE LIGHT IN THE DISTANCE AND ALL I NEED TO DO TO BASK IN THAT LIGHT IS TO HOLD THROUGH A FEW MORE UPS AND DOWNS!      Nothing, and I mean NOTHING, will stop me from getting to that light. I deserve that light my generation deserves that light. WE All deserve that light. it‚Äôs our right as human beings to live in that light and all we have to do to get there is FUCKING HOLD!!!!!!!!!  Not financial advice.

February 2nd I bought 4 more for 9.86, and 70 more for 8.17$... it closed that day in 7.82$... so far so good (haha)...stock expert me ate 2 crayons and cried in bed, tomorrow is the day people said, and didn¬¥t sell.  Next days continued falling. Tomorrow is the day people said...didn¬¥t sell.  On February 9 I bought 50 more at 5.55$ and then another 51 at 5.47$... thinking in average the mess down, that day didn¬¥t sell either. You know why? Because next day was the day, people said.  Next week or so the stock just MEH.. no up or downs, next day is the day people said, didn¬¥t sell.  Februay 22nd and 23rd started rising, so on the 24th I bought 90 more shares at 7.17$, because that was the day, people said, didn¬¥t sell.  Feb 26th we closed at 8.01$, next day is the big day, people said, so on March the 2nd I bought 200 more at 9.39$. Next day people said, didnt¬¥sell.  March 10th started rising and I panicked bought 173 more, because that was the day, or so people said...didn¬¥t sell...  Today... March the 16th I went all in, all my savings for another 389 more shares at 13.20, because you know... today was the day again... but it doesn¬¥t matter what people say...

50,$UWMC Gamma Squeeze DD,2ndDeriv,"This is not financial advice.  By now we all know what a gamma squeeze is, and generally speaking we know the conditions under which it occurs. This post is intended to very ignorantly explore the degree to which $UWMC might be squozed.  # Hypothetical example:  Take the following example given the following assumptions:  There is only one institution making $UWMC's market  * This market maker only hedges their positions using derivatives of $UWMC and the underlying itself * The MM is currently delta-neutral  Some Ape decides to buy some calls.  To be delta neutral after selling a call option, a market maker must own a certain number of shares equalling:  **Number of Contracts \* Delta \* 100.**  That is to say, if MM sells 10 OTM calls at time X with a 0.1 delta, they must buy 10 \* .1 \* 100 = 100 shares to be delta-neutral.  If the share price increases over time X + T such that those calls are now deep ITM, **and** the MM is still delta neutral **and** no other options activity took place, somewhere between time X and time T, the market maker must have necessarily purchased 900 additional shares.  It follows then, that the effect a market maker will have on price due to delta hedging is inversely related to the ratio of volume/float. **Simply put,** delta hedging has more of an effect on low-float, lower-liquidity names.   &amp;#x200B;  **OK, where is the ape math for UWMC?**  Here it is:  What if UWMC were to hit $9? A potentially cascading effect:  The $9 and $10 calls would have a delta of \~53, and \~25 respectively, requiring MM's to purchase:  16,765 \* (.53-.34) \* 100 = 318,535 shares to be hedged on the $9's  38,823 \* (.25-.13) \* 100 = 465,875 shares to be hedged on the $10's  .... ect for the rest but I don't want to do the math. The number is bigger than 1M obvs. Someone else can do the math there's probly a tool for it but im hungry af and need to sleep. Multiply this by 3 and thats the MM hedging requirements for the next 3 options expiries. Delta curve its not the same but good enough for ape math. If it starts running it could go for a while, or it might not get enough steam.  Volume has been between average of 7M for the last 10 days, with a public float of 90M.  The potential is definitely there. I also like UWMC as a mortgage company because of the way they are. Pics below for reference.  [UWMC 3\/19 options chain on 3\/16 EOD](   This next picture shows how the 3/19 $9 call's delta moves w/respect to price, all else equal.

55,Tips for those paying to share advisor subscriptions (like MF) on reddit. Be careful.,Opportunist_Ad3972,"I'm a subscriber myself mostly always. But I've also been burnt when trying to share with others. So here are my best tips for you.  Before sending anyone money  1. ask them to send you a screenshot by mail showing them logged into the subscription, with your dm visible in the same screenshot - proving that they really are subscribed to the service, and not just reselling you a point-in-time copy of the picks they received from someone else. 2. ask them to describe to you what they publish and how. Just knowing the picks for a portfolio is not at all enough. Subscriptions come with picks, updates, guidance, allocations, ranking, supporting articles through the year. Without that, you're just dead-in-the-water starting a portfolio without knowing where to take it a month later. 3. sign up for promo emails from MF. they'll send you promo emails of when new services are starting and even sometimes when their services have big updates baiting you into buying. something like ""round 1 of 10x is out. Last chance to subscribe"". Of course your not buying, but when those emails do reach you, you know that you should be getting an update from whoever you paid to share in. And if they don't publish timely updates, well...  Be careful and happy investing.",wallstreetbets,1,1615964465,m6ugn8

Here's why I'm dumping/have dumped MUCH of my money in to G EM EEEEEEEEEEEEEE. Forgive me for being a little long winded. I have been drinking a nice bottle of Bordeaux and holy bananas.  I believe that the stock market is the best opportunity maker the world has ever known. I have seen it's rewards personally, and I know many of you have as well. Over the past few months I have gone through many emotions. It began as - heh - who would invest in a bad decision like this. Foolish. I have since refined and clarified my position. I am a true believer in the FREE market system. What I do not believe in is when the market is not able to live up to it's promises. Everyone stands a chance, right? We have seen very clearly over the past few weeks how this  ""freedom"" and these chances can be taken away from us by those who are more powerful, manipulative, and `perhaps,` most likely criminal.  I have seen post after post from those of your APES (NERDS) in my language with some fantastic analysis. Some seems like is has been posted without opposable thumbs? The fact of the matter is there are some brilliant minds in this community. One which I am proud to finally be a member of.  I know that many of us are scared about what might happen next. I know from time to time I have felt that way too. What I do know for certain is this. Nobody should have the power to tell the ""voters"" what a company or it's stock should be OR is worth. They can ""believe"" what they like. They can even bet on it. But when manipulation gets involved - that's when people in my profession SHOULD be getting worried. We should be worried about our money. We should be worried about our clients money (circumstantially). But what do most of us do? We turn the blind eye. I have CHOSEN to do the opposite. I have committed and continue to commit to the cause. TO THE MOON!  Anyway onto why you might be actually reading this.  What I can tell you this this. If we HODL, and even buy more shares when we see the dips - we can still ""win"" this fight. Purchase in the money calls and if you're so willing to BUY shares at the same time - purchase just ""above"" the money calls. Make sure you consult with other apes you know first - because a LOT of us need to do this. VOLUME is the only thing that will keep this thing alive. We know the hedgies have a lot of volume to work with, but we got free money coming and they don't.

91,Why UWMC is no match for RKT in the long term,CMScientist,"First, I'm not talking about any squeeze potential, which can happen to either/both stocks. I'm interested in the business models of these companies.  **Intro**  I think many people are familiar with the RKT/UWMC feud after the RKT squeeze put both in the spot light. UWMC issued an ultimatum to mortgage brokers to stop working with other companies, which supposedly 90% of their existing broker partners agreed to. Many people here and on other subreddits are invested, and claiming each of these companies are significantly undervalued. I just want to put things into perspective from the business model side and future outlook side.   **Business Model - direct lending and broker lending**  First, let's talk about their business models. RKT is fairly diversified a number of lending businesses, with their TPO division for brokers but majority of their mortgage lending business direct to consumer. On the other hand, UWMC only deal with mortgage brokers, who make their cut between the lender and consumer.   In general, consumers with good credit and who has long standing existing banking relations with a bank or credit union will go there first. They may compare a few lenders to get the best rate, but generally working with lenders directly, especially if they know someone in the business. Only when you have a special circumstance on your credit history/rating or when you can't get a satisfactory loan directly from your local lenders, then your realtor may suggest going to a broker. Brokers make money because they may be able to get you a loan that otherwise you may not (or shouldn't) qualify for. This actually contributed a lot to the mortgage default crisis in 08.   When I bought my first house I had a special circumstance for my loan application and couldn't get the loan size that I wanted with lenders, and my realtor suggested we can go find brokers who can find high interest rate loans of that size, some of them even from private lenders. Luckily we were able to find a credit union that could work with us. But you get the gist - mortgage brokers sometimes work with (and sometimes prey on) people with low credit who can't loans directly from lenders, and this is what they get paid for. Not all brokers are bad, but there is definitely a ""car salesman"" feeling from them. In the end, I would think the loans that brokers push through are in general more risky than direct to consumer loans. I don't work in the business but people who do could find some statistics. When rates starts to rise, and also after the mortgage moratorium end, the first to default will be these higher interest rate loans from brokers. I think RKT is positioned better than UWMC in a higher interest rate environment.  **Innovation and growth**  This will go hand in hand with the valuation section below. Brokers, no matter what they are brokering, are a thing of the past. With information and technology, the trend is definitely for individuals to browse and pick on their own. This is not to say everything should be automated. Especially for a big purchase like a house, professional help is needed and this is why realtors still have a job even with the rise of Zillow and Redfin etc. But professional help is really only need for getting legal things done and for things that requires tacit skills like negotiating prices on an offer. Mortgage requirements are for the most part set in stone and rates are mostly non-negotiable. So what is the job of the broker? They just aggregate information for you, which technology is poised to do just as well, if not better. Technology also brings transparency so everyone's competing on a level field; you don't need to ""know a guy"" to get your loan at the best rates for your situation. This kind of no frills experience is the new way of doing business and led to the rise of Zillow, Carmax, lemonade, etc. RKT is trying to do that and this is what will transform the mortgage industry, not someone like UWMC, who is just trying to squeeze both the brokers and consumers to get more profits in the short term and stay alive.  **valuation**   A lot of people are talking of each companies valuations relative to many metrics like sales and earnings. You cannot compare these ratios to the tech and meme growth stocks that we are all so familiar with. Just go to finviz and put in P/S under 4 and see how many companies show up. If a company doesn't have high margins and/or potential for exponential growth, they will not and should not carry a huge P/S ratio. For UWMC, I don't see any way this company can grow very fast or innovate, especially given their hostile attitude towards their own broker partners. For RKT it's harder to say whether their technologies like the mostly automatic underwriting process, and also their attempt to have good UI and customer service, is enough to be deserving of a high valuation. But at least I do see them transforming the traditional mortgage business and I think they stand a high chance of maintaining their rapid growth as more tech-savvy people start to purchase homes.  **Summary**  Don't just buy into UWMC because they spiked later than RKT and they ""seem like an undervalued"" stock. A quick look at the different approaches of these two companies clearly reveals who is the innovative ""sleeping giant"" and who is the boomer stock. While both may be good speculative short term plays, if you are serious long term investor I would take a long and hard at these companies.  Not financial advice, just my 2 cents on these two hot tickers. I'm holding RKT shares and leaps, invested before the spike, sold some profit and hold the rest for medium to long term.",wallstreetbets,1,1615962803,m6u2km

95,Is it possible to trade in a team?,pooloftraders,"   What is a team in my understanding and how I see it - the image of an ideal!  1. a team of 3-5 people, this is the maximum. 2. all team members must be the same in temperament, character, ambition and other psycho-characteristics. This will help the participant quickly feel like a part of the team and quickly reach their potential. This point seems to me the most important! 3. all team members must share the same area of ‚Äã‚Äãanalysis and trading decisions. By sphere, I do not mean a specific trading strategy, but a subsection to which it belongs. The narrower the sphere, the more effective the result and understanding within the team will be. 4. clear internal rules - working hours, money management, risk management, preferably the same capital of the participants. 5. it is desirable to work in one room, but this is certainly unlikely, but this is also a very important factor!

77,Power to the Player's Handbook of holding: a Dungeon Master's guide to maximizing profits &amp; prophets; a short story with a long title and too many puns part 5 - the Position or 'Band of Heroes',artmagic95833,"#Once in the land of Terra in the City of MemeStonkia did the venerable James Cramer, level 5 wizard / level 1 warlock, perfect his spell of casting his visage upon the clouds above. Nightly would he prophesy about his visions of the future.    One day he spoke of the fair weather to come, but instead Vikings from the West raided. Disappointed, the survivors put away their Beach gear and decided not every person with the power to cast their face upon the clouds was particularly worth listening to necessarily.  Years passed and the city was rebuilt. One afternoon a guild of magic using, upper-middle class mercenaries, devoid of any moral alignment, discovered the secret to James's spell and proceeded to have their own visions of the future and discuss them in the tavern sector of main Street, projecting their visages upon the buildings and discussing what they thought.  ""Let's all Buy gamestop stocks"" they decided together, some of them being sober enough to notice GameStop stock price would rise with every console release.   And so they did, but then they had a problem.  The stock was suddenly going to go to 50,000 gold pieces according to some visions. In others it only went to 100. Still others insisted just one share of the stock would grant the owner immortal Life, like a reverse lich or something I don't know.   And in all the arguing over when to sell it became more and more clear that most would sell at a low price and only a few would wait for a higher one.  Now a certain gnome studying for his PhD in counting things said, ""how about we play a game to determine when we sell our stock? That way we all get maximum profits?""  And this was the game that they made up:  #Everyday you want to sell, flip a coin. On heads sell 10% of your GameStop stock, on tails sell 5%. You must wait 24 hours minimum to flip again.  This game ensured that no one got left with a bag of holding, which was a perfectly reasonable thing to discuss given the circumstances that all these investors found themselves in.   This didn't mean one witlessely sold every day! It just meant at any time one wanted to sell you would have to flip a coin and wait 24 hours and then flip a coin and then wait 24 hours and then flip a coin and then wait 24 hours. They did the 5 or 10% thing to further maximize profits, using stochastic measured divestment strategies to further flatten volatility and prevent emotional human bias. So at most you would have to flip a coin 20 times in order to sell 100% of your shares, having sold 5% each time you sold, and the fastest you could possibly sell off would be 10 days before you would have zero stock left to sell.  This is part 5. Part one got taken down due to a Clerical error on my part. I'm really Paladin my karma anyway. Fighter flight isn't in my vocabulary, I was bound to LEAP in, given all my options, and if this is finally enough I'll cleave it alone. Whirlwind strike took out parts two, three and IV.

79,"1 year and 2 weeks ago, wallstreetbets started loading up on puts on travel, casino, SPY, well pretty much everything",lolfunctionspace,"Alright, tuck yourself in. It's story time.  It was February 2020. The markets were roaring at all time highs, the mods were super gay, and the air smelled like WSBgod's cum along with thousands of wsb folk getting rich on absurdly far OTM TSLA calls (seriously *retardedly* far out of the money calls... I'm not joking here). The atmospheric composition in here was 78% nitrogen, 21% oxygen, and 1% adderall dust.  The winds were changing though. It gradually stopped smelling like cum, and instead started smelling more like viral RNA of bat meat origin. Wallstreetbets was coming to grips with what was about to happen to the world, and CNBC was still talking about the democratic primaries and how extraordinarily overvalued TSLA is (lol).  Here is an example DD from that era. For context, there had been 15 confirmed cases in the US when this was written, and the uncertainty around the IFR of the disease was still large.     Notice what's in that thread? Sourced information. Predictions. Price targets. Tickers. Wild napkin calculations. We were scrapping and fighting for anything we could get. There are hundreds of threads like these in WSB from early pandemic era in late February. Bulls lined up and bought calls (rip), Bears lined up and bought puts ($$$), and the mods made one guy drink his own piss because of TSLA.  When NYC got hit, just as we had predicted, the markets started to free fall. The S&amp;P 500 crashed over 35% in a matter of 2 weeks, and this sub got fucking rich. The front page was inundated with +10,000% gain porn from calls on VIX, SPY puts, casino, cruise, and airline puts. Occasionally there would be funny loss porn from some poor cannon fodder of a human bag holding MSFT 220 c, but we didn't laugh at them until they finally bought puts at the literal hard bottom of the crash.  My point is, we got rich because of good DD. We scrounged around where most news outlets did not. We found the preprints, we read the early travel and epidemiological models, we knew what was coming here. We didn't make up crazy theories based on wild leaps in logic.  tl;dr Do your due diligence, make sure it's *actually* good and it makes fucking sense before hitting the post button. Your goal here is to get rich, so be honest and unbiased in your assessments.   Thanks, and go fuck yourselves.",wallstreetbets,1,1615959353,m6t8ev

But looking past the money, when we get to the end of this, America will really become the land of the FREE! Imagine. A life with no student loans, no mortgage, and no car notes. Nothing Other than excitement for the coming day keeping you up at night. To be truly Free! This is what this war is about.           Big banks have lured many into their illusion of freedom enslaving many for generations; we have seen now that they control the media so our narrative on freedom have been scripted to their benefit. But the tides are turning! Technology has shone a BRIGHT light in the darkness they have kept us in for centuries. And now it is UP TO US TO DO WHAT IS NECESSARY to reclaim our freedom. WE BUY, AND WE MOTHER FUCKING HOLD!!!    Think about it. Why do you think they are fighting so hard? They know that losing this war will break open the flood gates which they have put in place to control our progress. They also know that this war will usher in A NEW ERA!  One where we will see currency FULLY decentralized, monopolistic capitalist strongholds crumble and be replaced with a more human centric, and earth conscious leaders. One where humanity can truly shine forth (we seen so Many examples of humanitarian acts just off the little gains we‚Äôve seen so far) and address issues of our planet. Hedgies are fighting so hard because in this new word, they would be punished for all their crimes against humanity. So they are fighting for their lives!! But this is an uphill battle for them that is slowly coming to a devastating and climatic END!

I have been through so much uncertainty in my life. So much hardship. But what has kept me going is the belief that there is a light at the end of the tunnel And giving up now only means I will never get to see that light. Using that mindset in this war, I SEE THE LIGHT IN THE DISTANCE AND ALL I NEED TO DO TO BASK IN THAT LIGHT IS TO HOLD THROUGH A FEW MORE UPS AND DOWNS!      Nothing, and I mean NOTHING, will stop me from getting to that light. I deserve that light my generation deserves that light. WE All deserve that light. it‚Äôs our right as human beings to live in that light and all we have to do to get there is FUCKING HOLD!!!!!!!!!  Not financial advice.

2,Dr. Stonklove or: How I Learned to Love Basic Market Knowledge (GME edition),JJ_Shosky,"Good evening retards,  I felt the need to write this because of another post on here that got quite a bit of traction regarding GME. The submission was titled "" **GME has a -8 Beta. Evidence shorts have yet to cover** "" and it had a screenshot of what I believe was a bloomberg terminal with the beta information.  **BASIC STOCK KNOWLEDGE:**  The thing is, BETA HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH SHORT POSITIONS AT ALL.   ‚ÄãBeta= Variance/Covariance‚Äã   **where:**Covariance=Measure¬†of¬†a¬†stock‚Äôs¬†return¬†relative to¬†that¬†of¬†the¬†market Variance=Measure¬†of¬†how¬†the¬†market¬†moves¬†relative to¬†its¬†mean‚Äã.   What does all them words mean? It means Beta is just a calculation of how a stock reacts compared to the general market. It is generally a number between 0 and 1 but it is still common to find a beta higher or lower than 1 and 0 respectively. It doesn't take into account how an individual stock will move when there are upcoming catalysts, it just gives you a general indicator of how a stock has been performing compared to the general market.  Here is a link for more information on BETA: [   **SO WHAT DOES GME HAVING A -8 BETA MEAN?**  GME having a -8 beta doesn't give us any new information. It tells us that the Beta calculation doesn't know what the fuck to expect from GME when the market is up or down because it's movements have had no relation to the market, the longer GME doesn't react to the overall market the further away from the normal range it gets.  Want to take a wild guess as to why?   retard 1: MARKET MANIPULATION  No, shut the fuck up retard,  retard 2: uh, we like the stock?  Good job retard, It's because a large group of apes have been focused on one stock and buying it regardless of what the rest of the market is doing for 3 months, so it is acting entirely independent of the market. It means that on a day the market is down 10%, GME might go up 500%. On a day the market is up 5%, GME might go up 20%. On a day the market is up, GME might go down 200%. Poor beta bitch doesn't know what the fuck is going on.  **SO WHY DID THAT POST SAY IT WAS PROOF THE SHORTS HAVEN'T COVERED?:**  Good question, I think we found the autist in the group. I was wondering that too, and then the account that posted it deleted their entire account 2 hours after the post.   Had the poster not deleted their account, I may have thought they were just a dumb fuck and let it go, but now I am suspicious that the purpose of that post was to test all of you, and I think that test was very successful. What were they testing? How you react to confirmation bias when you're shown information you don't understand. I have to say it exposed a FUCKTON of people that were ready to rally behind the information and lend support to the theory as though they knew what the information meant. A lot of the people that saw that thread will probably wake up tomorrow and post about how GME's beta is -8 in the webull comment section, I plan on checking that in the morning.  **BUT WHY MAKE A POST HYPING GME WITH BAD INFORMATION IF WE'RE ALREADY HYPED ABOUT GME?**  It's not so much about the stock itself, it's about potential to manipulate how the community thinks, or things they will look at when making decisions on a stock. Maybe a month from now someone posts some exciting DD with pretty colors and graphs that have nonsense information, general sentiment in the thread is positive and people throw their money in pumping up the stock price. Maybe they were testing how long the mods would leave the post up with bull shit information. I'm not sure why they did it specifically, I can't know, but you should be aware of shit like that.  Here is the comment section graveyard from that thread so you can decide for yourself how effective it was: [   &amp;#x200B;  **SO YOU PROVED THE POST WAS BULLSHIT BUT WHAT'S YOUR POINT I STILL LIKE GME:**  My point is, even if you are the laziest of fucks and all of your DD is whatever is trending on WSB, at A BARE FUCKING MINIMUM GOOGLE TERMS THAT YOU DON'T KNOW BEFORE GETTING HYPED ABOUT SHIT AND THROWING YOUR MONEY AT IT. You're in a community of retards, some retard telling you what something means doesn't necessarily mean they are correct, they're retarded after all. By now you're probably interested in the stock market and when GME and AMC do their thing you'll probably still throw some money around at stocks, accumulate some basic market knowledge as you go along. Like a WSB word of the day calendar look up one thing a day and sooner or later maybe you'll be an autist. Probably not, but at least you'll be able to spot some bullshit when you see it.",wallstreetbets,1,1615958216,m6sxps

Lightning eMotors is an EV company that already has revenue and focuses on converting Class 3-7 trucks from gas to electric. They have a partnership with $PLUG and they have been rumored to be working with Amazon. At $12.50, this is a steal. The SEC is due to respond back to GIK team by 3/19 Friday the latest, after GIK team responded with answers to the 6 additional questions the SEC asked for 15 days ago. I see GIK running to $20 minimum on merger news and higher if they get some more high and bullish PTs. I also think it‚Äôs a fantastic long term hold for $30-35+ because of the fact that Biden wants to make all government vehicles EV and EV is just the future 4/16 $15 calls are an okay play under $1.00 entry but beware that the SEC could delay the merger another 2 weeks so July ITM calls are safer GIK warrants at $3.25 and under are also a great play",wallstreetbets,1,1615958127,m6swyy
14,In a world full of overvalued inflated stocks.....Alibaba is a diamond in a rough,Amurphy747,"Hello fellow autists,  I am presenting an opportunity that has risk but the rewards are much lucrative. Alibaba (BABA) is a severely undervalued tech stock that serves over 1 billion people. **BILLION.** Lately Alibaba has had a barrel of bad news but every analyst and hedge fund on the street agrees on one thing...it is a premier undervalued blue chip tech stock. Nowadays where you fuckers throw 30% OTM calls at all sorts of stuff even though the stock is at 52 week highs. Well I am presenting you a diamond in the rough that also happens to be a mega cap.   **What is Alibaba?**   Alibaba Group Holding Limited, also known as Alibaba Group and as Alibaba.com, is a Chinese multinational technology company specializing in e-commerce, retail, Internet, and technology. The company provides consumer-to-consumer (C2C), business-to-consumer (B2C), and business-to-business (B2B) sales services via web portals, as well as electronic payment services, shopping search engines and cloud computing services. It owns and operates a diverse portfolio of companies around the world in numerous business sectors. **To summarize it is the Chinese Amazon (AMZN) and does all sorts of things.**  &amp;#x200B;  &amp;#x200B;     **Alibaba is a great company with great growth prospects but you don't need me to tell you that just look at the numbers.**   \-Alibaba‚Äôs e-revenue for 2020 was $41.7 billion  \- The latest available info shows that the Alibaba Group held 55.9% of the Chinese ecommerce market  \- In Q3 2020, the percentage of profits that Alibaba generated just from commerce in China was 62%.   \- Alibaba‚Äôs GMV on Singles‚Äô Day in 2020 reached $74.1 billion.  \-**THE PE RATIO IS 24 FOR FUCKS SAKE for a super growth company**  With a five-year annualized¬† earnings growth rate of 29% and a sales growth rate of 47%, it's hard to find a company with a more impressive track record of growth than Alibaba. It's been a big winner since its IPO in September 2014.  Expectations were high for Alibaba's Singles Day annual shopping event in November, and the company didn't disappoint as sales nearly doubled from the year-ago period to $74 billion.  The company has been able to stay in growth mode despite a slowdown in its core e-commerce business.  Alibaba's business in China looks a lot like Amazon's in the U.S. Alibaba's **cloud-computing business** is showing solid growth, just like Amazon's booming web services business.  Alibaba also sees dollar signs in food delivery. In 2018, it merged its food delivery service Ele.me with its lifestyle app Koubei to better compete with Tencent (TCEHY)-owned Meituan.  Sales at Alibaba's digital media and entertainment unit are also rising. The unit includes Alibaba's video streaming platform Youku, along with its music streaming service, Xiami. Alibaba also has a licensing agreement with Walt Disney (DIS) unit Buena Vista International, giving it access to a large amount of Disney content.  **Why buy Alibaba right now? They have got butt fucked raw the past few months by the Chinese government? Most recently the Chinese government told Alibaba to dump their media assets.**    The risk is simple, will the Chinese government continue to make investors uneasy and weigh on Alibaba. They just told them to dump their media assets.... which weirdly enough would be bullish.  An analyst at Morgan Stanley made the case that it would be a positive for Alibaba to do so, as it would improve its margins and provide it with more capital. Their media assets lose them money. The analyst reiterated the firm's overweight rating and $320 price target. **It has only been negative news lately and you must buy when others are fearful.**   I am a capitalist loving spitfuck, I am no commie. If you want capitalism to thrive throw some money into this strong fundamental company.  **What is the play and why now?**  **May 21 240 Calls**   The stock has gotten wrecked and has showed stabilization. This is a great opportunity to enter in and ride it to tendie town. Worst case scenario it breaks 220 support and you eat the losses. Best case scenario it skyrockets leading up to earnings in May and you cash out for great gains. It will by no means be an easy diamond hands. This stock moves very crazily, I am currently down 9% on my calls. But when IV picks back up and it skyrockets we will be driving lambos. üöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄ  On my etrade research all the analysts have price targets of 285+, average target of 325, and highest being 395. And those guys get paid a lot more than I do to do research.  Cannot go tits up.   Lets ride this.",wallstreetbets,1,1615957946,m6sv8z

60,MARCH 17th DD Gme/Amc,Asmosewins,"This is not financial advise.  Yeah, I have a newer account, fuck off about it. This was done at 11Am, March 16th.  TLDR: AMC is showing signs of a reversal right out of open/premarket. Almost all MACD time charts support this, and so does RSI.   GME is set for a red day. Yeah I know, I expected to be in a better spot, but unfortunately I'd expect more of a sell off most of tomorrow, we are seeing constant manipulation of Hedges painting the tape on stocks, bouncing sales back and forth at a volume of 60,61,62, shares etc. Whatever it is, go look at the order book most days, its completely obvious. We SHOULD have finally gotten  into an uptrend on March 16, but because of this we didn't. Unfortunately the MACD is poised for us to have another possibly bad run all of tomorrow and possible untill Friday.   My opinion: I expect an abnormality to occur at some point. This isn't normal trading, we SHOULDN'T  be trading sideways like this, it isn't healthy or natural. I think similar to ENDGAME Dd, we will see a completely unpredictable abnormality between March 17th and 19.   What we need to do: LOOK AT THE FUCKING MACD LOOK AT THE FUCKING ORDER BOOK.  You fucking apes want this shit to happen? Stop watching guys on YouTube not even displaying the information that matters, you NEED to learn how, and when to act on this reversal or your just going to fuck everyone. Whoever the good hedge is, or the whale, who is fighting for us, will act at some point, and it will be obvious to anyone watching MACD and order books.  YOU WANT TENDIES?

68,Lumen Technologies Inc (LUMN) - Too Late To the Party?,hfh7dc," r/wallstreetbets  Hello, fellow retards and autists.  I need to borrow your diligent, Aspergers level analytics ability and earth-shatteringly, retarded reasoning to pile drive my portfolio into the red.  I can't believe I'm actually coming here for advice.  Please see the ""case study"" below.  I'm a huge fan of Dr. Michael Burry and how he manages Scion Asset Management, LLC. The guy does his due-diligence and thinks about his investment opportunities from an outside perspective. If the numbers and story pencil, he will bet against anyone and doesn't let the court of public opinion cloud his judgment.  I'm inquiring about the recent Lumen Technologies (formerly CenturyLink) $LUMN trade.  Based on my research, Scion Asset Management acquired 1.15M shares of $LUMN at an average value of $9.74 per share. This trade accounts for approx. 8.02% of Scion's portfolio. If we're looking at Burry's past investments, he's usually one of the first players to the table including both $GME (#diamond hands) and shorting the housing market.   Lumen has not only rebranded their name and marketing efforts, but their entire business strategy moving forward by selling B2B data and fiber optic services since many customers are moving away from phone lines/services: (direct quotes from my research)...  1. ""**Lumen** is a measure of the brightness of light, and the company‚Äôs competitive advantage this century has come from its massive fiber network, stretching 450,000 route miles. That has helped CenturyLink survive even as consumers cut their home phone lines in favor of wireless providers and switched off DSL in favor of faster alternatives. But transporting light signals can also be a commodity service. Lumen is now pushing to offer more higher-value applications and enterprise services directly to its customers, reflected in the company‚Äôs new motto: ‚Äú**The Platform for Amazing Things**.‚Äù 2. ""Lumen, which was primarily an ISP/Phone company, stepped up their B2B and backbone connectivity to major Internet companies which the purchase of Level3. They'll be key to serving as the fiber backbone for 5G.""  Earlier today, I submitted a limit buy order for $LUMN @ $14.00 which won't be executed until tomorrow when the market opens. I don't believe this trade will turn a real profit for 1-2 years as turning a battleship of this size takes a significant amount of time and resources. But looking at the story and fundamentals, the strategy is sound. Outside the rebranding and change of strategy, Lumen is using some of the newly minted capital to paydown, high interest, debt.  Am I too late on this trade or too retarded to function?  Good or bad, let me hear it.",wallstreetbets,1,1615956240,m6se82
76,AK Interview Summary,Chrononubz,"Karp's interview is being overblown.  The headlines are clickbait.  He talks America needing software(pure software/AI) that is the best to AVOID conflict in order to stay ahead of America's adversaries. Basically he's claiming Palantir Technologies to be S class disruptive Tech that can lead future innovations for America.  Karp would rather put his focus on having the company put its ""best foot forward"" for the sake of protecting America and its private and public interests.  He was asked in the middle of the interview ""How would he entice new commercial customers?""  He then starts talking about the how Foundry and Gotham are unique technically speaking ( claims his tech is 5 years ahead of everyone else low key), and the way they do business is unique.  For example he explains that Palantir  in the commercial space, Foundry is a Finished product as opposed to other ERP systems that require you to do an entire IT installation that can take months.  Foundry can be installed as a whole stack in a few days!  That difference is how Karp and Palantir thinks Software companies will sell their products.  He mentions that typically ERP systems entice customers with Jargon that promises to deliver instead of providing a product that stands out from the rest.  He truly believes Palantir is in a class of its own.   He actually believes despite having Elite tech that he provides for the biggest companies in the word, he thinks that Palantir can provide a ton of value to smaller to medium companies by offering superior ERP Software transforming their business to save them millions of dollars.  They talk little bit about PLTRs partnerships including 3M, BP, IBM, and AWS.  They talk about how IBM and AWS were thought to be rival companies to Palantir but instead decided to join forces because those companies understand how difficult it is to build what Palantir built with Foundry and Gotham.  HE LIKES THE RETAIL INVESTORS, he HATES the ""INVESTORS"" who buy and sell the stock who don't have any clue about the company or its Tech.  He can't on camera ""PUMP"" the stock, so he just talks about how he's more focused on building the Company for the long-term.  TLDR  So about a fucking hour talking about how superior the tech( Foundry/Gotham) is compared to any other software company's tech and how Karps ideological view of supporting America and its western values by providing Superiority and Complexity in order to stay ahead of its adversaries.  Foundry is 5 years ahead of any other ERP software in the market.  IBM and AWS bow down to PLTR.  Intrigued yet?  I plan to hold this 10 years plus.  235 shares@ 24.68, 6x  PLTR 4/1 30c",wallstreetbets,1,1615956044,m6sc8l

81,"Power to the Player's Hands Book of Holding: A Dungeon Masters Guide to maximizing Profits &amp; Prophets; Session IV - Too Many Puns, a short story told long positions, our band of Heroes discovers!",artmagic95833,"Once in the land of Terra in the City of MemeStonkia did the venerable James Cramer, level 5 wizard / level 1 warlock, perfect his spell of casting his visage upon the clouds above. Nightly would he prophesy about his visions of the future.   One day he spoke of the fair weather to come, but instead Vikings from the West raided. Disappointed, the survivors put away their Beach gear and decided not every person with the power to cast their face upon the clouds was particularly worth listening to necessarily.  Years passed and the city was rebuilt. One afternoon a guild of magic using, upper-middle class mercenaries, devoid of any moral alignment, discovered the secret to James's spell and proceeded to have their own visions of the future and discuss them in the tavern sector of main Street, projecting their visages upon the buildings and discussing what they thought.  ""Let's all Buy gamestop stocks"" they decided together, some of them being sober enough to notice GameStop stock price would rise with every console release.   And so they did, but then they had a problem.  The stock was suddenly going to go to 50,000 gold pieces according to some visions. In others it only went to 100. Still others insisted just one share of the stock would grant the owner immortal Life, like a reverse lich or something I don't know.   And in all the arguing over when to sell it became more and more clear that most would sell at a low price and only a few would wait for a higher one.  Now a certain gnome studying for his PhD in counting things said, ""how about we play a game to determine when we sell our stock? That way we all get maximum profits?""  And this was the game that they made up:  #Everyday you want to sell, flip a coin. On heads sell 10% of your GameStop stock, on tails sell 5%. You must wait 24 hours minimum to flip again.  This game ensured that no one got left with a bag of holding, which was a perfectly reasonable thing to discuss given the circumstances that all these investors found themselves in.   This didn't mean one witlessely sold every day! It just meant at any time one wanted to sell you would have to flip a coin and wait 24 hours and then flip a coin and then wait 24 hours and then flip a coin and then wait 24 hours. They did the 5 or 10% thing to further maximize profits, using stochastic measured divestment strategies to further flatten volatility and prevent emotional human bias. So at most you would have to flip a coin 20 times in order to sell 100% of your shares, having sold 5% each time you sold. in the fastest you could possibly sell off would be 10 days before you would have zero stock left to sell.  This is part IV, and it seems the story is volatile. Part one got taken down due to a Clerical error on my part. I'm really just Paladin my karma anyway. Fighter flight isn't in my vocabulary, I just was bound to LEAP in, given all my options, and if that's not enough I'll cleave it alone. Whirlwind strike took out part two and three.   * * Authors note: The magical power of projecting your face on the wall is pretty annoying but not illegal in the City of MemeStonkia to this day. *",wallstreetbets,1,1615955879,m6sao3

I can‚Äôt sleep as I am preparing to go on nights, so I spent some time on FINRA‚Äôs website looking at short volumes because bears suck and I found $CSTL   I have no position in $CSTL and I don‚Äôt plan to take one.  $CSTL has a 1.6bn mktcp and little to no option interest and what interest there is all puts and those bears are going get fucked here.   WTF is $SCTL Castle Biosciences makes melanoma tests, and is using AI and genetic profiles to make predictive outcomes on melanoma cancer.   In December CSTL got partial medicare approval for their most advanced Melanoma screening, on the LCD level. To you people who know nothing about biotechs, let me school you why this is huge. FDA approval is great, but if CMS (admin for Medicare and Medicaid) won‚Äôt pay for whatever widget the biotech is hawking than the company is going out of business. LCD approval means with a geographical area, the test is paid for. For CSTL that area represents 90% of the melanoma diagnoses in the US.  tl;dr CSTL is going to get PAID when hot girl summer starts and my wife and her boyfriend start fucking outside.   Let‚Äôs talk pipeline, IE what have you done from me lately. CSTL is growing their testing portfolio from 2bn TAM to 5bn. They clearly are not planning on being a one-hit wonder looking for a buyout.   Okay we know what the do and that they are going to get paid for it. Lets DD on their financials.   This past year they retired all of their debt, ALL OF THEIR DEBT, and they quadruped their Cash on hand from 100mm to 400mm. No debt, tons of cash, test getting CMS payment approval, growth to the moon baby.   Versus other biotech test companies, they have higher revenue growth and a higher profit margin.  ROE, ROI, ROA all meet or exceed the industry.   Let‚Äôs look at the negatives, their latest results showed a -.24 v estimate of -.12. No surprise there people were staying inside due to COVID and retiring all of their debt. With only 84% institutional ownership it shows skepticism for future growth, but the vaccine is here and people will be going outside. PT on the stock is 90.00 and it exceeded that back in march.

24,This post is manipulation but not market manipulation: The Dungeon Master's Guide to Exiting GME with Maximum Profits &amp; Prophets; Power to the Player's Hands Guide - (a short story) Part 2,artmagic95833,"Once in the land of Terra in the City of MemeStonkia did the venerable James Cramer, level 5 wizard / level 1 warlock, perfect his spell of casting his visage upon the clouds above. Nightly would he prophesy about his visions of the future.   One day he spoke of the fair weather to come, but instead Vikings from the West raided. Disappointed, the survivors put away their Beach gear and decided not every person with the power to cast their face upon the clouds was particularly worth listening to necessarily.  Years passed and the city was rebuilt. One afternoon a guild of magic using, upper-middle class mercenaries, devoid of any moral alignment, discovered the secret to James's spell and proceeded to have their own visions of the future and discuss them in the tavern sector of main Street, projecting their visages upon the buildings and discussing what they thought.  ""Let's all Buy gamestop stocks"" they decided together, some of them being sober enough to notice GameStop stock price would rise with every console release.   And so they did, but then they had a problem.  The stock was suddenly going to go to 50,000 gold pieces according to some visions. In others it only went to 100. Still others insisted just one share of the stock would grant the owner immortal Life, like a reverse lich or something I don't know.   And in all the arguing over when to sell it became more and more clear that most would sell at a low price and only a few would wait for a higher one.  Now a certain gnome studying for his PhD in counting things said, ""how about we play a game to determine when we sell our stock? That way we all get maximum profits?""  And this was the game that they made up:  #Everyday you want to sell, flip a coin. On heads sell 10% of your GameStop stock, on tails sell 5%. You must wait 24 hours to flip again.  This game ensured that no one got left with a bag of holding, which was a perfectly reasonable thing to discuss given the circumstances that all these investors found themselves in.   This didn't mean one witlessely sold every day! It just meant at any time you wanted to sell you would have to flip a coin and wait 24 hours and then flip a coin and then wait 24 hours and then flip a coin and then wait 24 hours. They did the 5 or 10% thing to further maximize profits, using stochastic measured divestment strategies to further flatten volatility and prevent emotional human bias.  This is part 2. Part one got taken down due to a clerical error on my part. I'm really just Paladin my karma anyway. Fighter flight isn't in my vocabulary, I just was bound to LEAP in, given all my options, and if that's not enough I'll cleave it alone. Whirlwind strike.  ^* Authors note: The magical power of projecting your face on the wall is pretty annoying but it's not illegal in the City of MemeStonkia to this day.",wallstreetbets,1,1615951629,m6r2uz

34,Alex Karp'snFull interview Breakdown 3/16,Chrononubz,"Karp's interview is being overblown.  The headlines are clickbait.  He talks America needing software(pure software/AI) that is the best to AVOID conflict in order to stay ahead of America's adversaries. Basically he's claiming Palantir Technologies to be S class disruptive Tech that can lead future innovations for America.  Karp would rather put his focus on having the company put its ""best foot forward"" for the sake of protecting America and its private and public interests.  He was asked in the middle of the interview ""How would he entice new commercial customers?""  He then starts talking about the how Foundry and Gotham are unique technically speaking ( claims his tech is 5 years ahead of everyone else low key), and the way they do business is unique.  For example he explains that Palantir  in the commercial space, Foundry is a Finished product as opposed to other ERP systems that require you to do an entire IT installation that can take months.  Foundry can be installed as a whole stack in a few days!  That difference is how Karp and Palantir thinks Software companies will sell their products.  He mentions that typically ERP systems entice customers with Jargon that promises to deliver instead of providing a product that stands out from the rest.  He truly believes Palantir is in a class of its own.   He actually believes despite having Elite tech that he provides for the biggest companies in the word, he thinks that Palantir can provide a ton of value to smaller to medium companies by offering superior ERP Software transforming their business to save them millions of dollars.  They talk little bit about PLTRs partnerships including 3M, BP, IBM, and AWS.  They talk about how IBM and AWS were thought to be rival companies to Palantir but instead decided to join forces because those companies understand how difficult it is to build what Palantir built with Foundry and Gotham.  HE LIKES THE RETAIL INVESTORS, he HATES the ""INVESTORS"" who buy and sell the stock who don't have any clue about the company or its Tech.  He can't on camera ""PUMP"" the stock, so he just talks about how he's more focused on building the Company for the long-term.  TLDR  So about a fucking hour talking about how superior the tech( Foundry/Gotham) is compared to any other software company's tech and how Karps ideological view of supporting America and its western values by providing Superiority and Complexity in order to stay ahead of its adversaries.  Foundry is 5 years ahead of any other ERP software in the market.  IBM and AWS bow down to PLTR.  Intrigued yet?

So I am working on a project recently, and I was scraping Reddit posts data to find out mentions for each ticker. I know that the scraper I used is not set up perfectly -- a lot of missing data happened, but I aggregated and scraped past month's top mentions.

So the chart is over here.  &amp;#x200B;     So NIO is the only stock with higher interests and growth of interest than its mention rank for daily, weekly, and monthly mentions -- what it means? It means that people are interested in it, and the talk around it is growing, and it snowballs. We can expect more discussion over NIO very soon. Why? From the posts, it seems that people are discussing it. You can check those yourself from [here](   &amp;#x200B;  Another interesting ticker would be NOK. Its weekly and monthly interest and growth of interest ranks are higher than the mention's rank, so definitely look into it. The other two tickers that might be good to look at are TLRY and APHA. They both have a higher interest growth of interest rank than their mentions rank.

(RBLX) rallied 6.1% in afternoon trading, after the tween-centric gaming platform received a bullish endorsement from Stifel Nicolaus analyst Drew Crum, who said the company is ""uniquely positioned at the intersection of content and social.""   Crum initiated coverage of Roblox with a buy rating and stock price target of $85, which is 11.0% above current levels.   üöÄ   Roblox received its first Wall Street analyst coverage on Monday, with Stifel rating the online gaming platform a Buy with a $85 price target, representing potential upside of 18% from Monday's close.  According to Stifel, the company is primed to benefit from two ""viral loops"" that should reinforce Roblox's network effect and drive higher engagement and monetization on the platform: content and social.   üöÄ   One key fact to put this in perspective is, in July 2019, Roblox claimed that 50% of American children aged 9 to 12 play on the platform, but, now, 75% of American children aged 9 to 12 play on the platform. But this isn't limited to just Roblox as 50% of 9-to-12-year-olds in the US, Canada, New Zealand, and Australia play either Roblox or Minecraft. The lines are blurring between ""video games"" and ""social media"" platforms, and Andreessen Horowitz developed a new framework for games.

This is AMC's market cap by quarters (notice 12/31 vs. Current):     *Processing img sijy5j8k4in61...*  &amp;#x200B;  Here's AMC's float (notice the jump from Sep 30 to Mar 11):  &amp;#x200B;     &amp;#x200B;  **Here's the evidence that hedgies sold converted their debt to equity:**   [   From this article:   ***""Silver Lake, which held a $600 million investment in the company‚Äôs bonds, immediately capitalized on the rally by converting the debt into equity and liquidating its entire position, capturing a $113 million profit.""***   &amp;#x200B;  What is AMC leadership doing with the share dilution:  ***""The struggling exhibition giant is to give $8.3 million to top execs for ""extraordinary efforts"" to keep AMC in business amid the COVID-19 crisis.""***  [   &amp;#x200B;  &amp;#x200B;  # I hold shares and not asking you to sell yours but requesting you to be price sensitive as the share goes higher. My cost basis is lower and I am selling calls to bring it even lower.   &amp;#x200B;     My new position starting today: IMAX 1/21/2022 22 calls at 3.3. It's a speculative position too - as with IMAX latest convertible note (which will again dilute shares for the shareholders), I felt the price was ""digestible"" after the IMAX sell-off today.",wallstreetbets,1,1615950292,m6qnyy

Please don‚Äôt forget the other apes as well though, I‚Äôve seen the situation in Indonesia at least firsthand and it‚Äôs quite dire, they desperately need our help!   For those who don‚Äôt know, Dian was one of three women sent to study apes by Dr. Louis Leakey. Dr. Jane Goodall and Dr. Birut√© Galdikas were the other two remarkable women who are both still very active in saving apes. Dr. Goodall obviously does a lot of speaking engagements, educational programs (roots and shoots) and conservation work at Gombe. Dr. Galdikas currently runs a care center with over 330 orphaned orangutans, and is working very diligently to purchase and preserve their habitat and save it from mining and palm oil companies, along with ongoing conservation and research in Tanjung Puting.   There are also Bonobos, who also have an orphanage in DRC called Lola Ya Bonobo.   Links for the lazy...

84,Open GME Calls &amp; Puts 03/19,PhraseAggressive3284,"I just had a look at the options chains of GME 03/19.  At 300$ there will be 11,619 Puts ITM and 77,465 Calls ITM.  At 200$ there are 19,620 Puts ITM and 54,045 Calls ITM.   At 150$ there will 50,619 Puts ITM and 43,915 Calls ITM.  &amp;#x200B;  **So what does this mean for friday 03/19?**  Every GME stock price above 300 $ will become a glorious tendies valhalla and might start the rocket to valhalla from friday on.  Every Dollar higher than 200$ will still be really painful for the shorters. So I guess that is the hedgies main goal until friday: to drill to the stock by any means lower than 200$.  Every Stock price below 150 $ on 03/19 will end in... well... So many PUTS then in the money, this will end really bad.  &amp;#x200B;  **TLDR:**    GME above \~170$ on friday, Calls will win, Stock will rise more.  GME above 300 $ on friday: Start to Valhalla  Anything below 150$ on friday: Here we go again, 40$ GME.  **So: Buy more calls in the money or near the money, apes!**",wallstreetbets,1,1615949869,m6qizs
